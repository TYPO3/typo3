The t3editor is based on the CodeMirror-project by Marijn Haverbeke (http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/)

Currently the release 0.66 is used.
To use the CodeMirror for the t3editor some changes were needed. 

See the LICENSE file for the CodeMirror license.
All files in this folder (typo3/sysext/t3editor/jslib/codemirror/) are part of or based on the CodeMirror and therefore licened under the CodeMirror license.

t3editor itself is part of TYPO3 and therefore licened under GPL (as TYPO3 is).
