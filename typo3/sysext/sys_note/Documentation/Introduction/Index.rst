What does it do?
================

The goal of the sys_note extension is to keep the backend more organized. You
can add notes for yourself or for other backend users.

The :sql:`sys_note` table in TYPO3 is a database table used for storing notes
or annotations related to records within your TYPO3 installation.
These notes can be added by administrators or users to provide additional
context or information about a specific record.
