	* this update closes bugs #3638, #2106, #2866, #3754 (for Firefox, broken in MSIE) and maybe a few more
	* Implemented support for sysLog() on connection failure
	* DBAL now honours the no_pconnect setting
	* For handlers in native mode the setDBinit queries are executed upon connection
	* The initial value for generated sequences can be configured per handler, to avoid duplicate key errors after having imported data
	* BLOB fields are handled correctly now during INSERT and UPDATE
	* Setting $store_lastBuiltQuery acts like in t3lib_db now (fill $debug_lastBuiltQuery)
	* For the native handler quoting methods directly return the input for speedup, as no quoting is needed in that case
	* Added support for native and userdefined handler to MetaType()
	* Changed mapping of types to always use the largest possible integer, map tinytext to varchar instead of text
	* admin_get_tables() skips tables whose names match /BIN\$/ (coming from the recycle bin on Oracle)
	* Importing dumps using the install tool now works, see manual for tips
	* Changed the way NOT NULL and DEFAULT are handled when setting up tables, see manual for the rules that now apply
	* Code cleanup (indentation, documentation)
	* Updated the manual and added new content

2006-01-19  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Added support for $no_quote_fields in UPDATE and INSERT methods.

2006-01-04  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Changed the way a connection is established with ADOdb. The new

	an underscore in their name).
	* Changes to ext_tables.sql to make it more portable.
	* When printing errors, output the offending SQL as well.
	* Some small fixes, enhancements to code documentation.
	* Some additions to the manual.

2005-12-27  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Converted locallang to XML, small adaptions to syext location.
	* One slight fix to the SQL check in the BE module (wrong output if
	an error occurred).

2005-12-26  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Code cleanup and improvements to the mapping. Merged 3rd
	party changes done by DIACC GmbH.

2005-12-23  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Fixed a few issues that were left undiscovered yet.
	* Added a new module to test query building and parsing
	from the DBAL debug module.
	* Finalized fix for bug #1649.

2005-12-22  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Fixed bug #2077 (NOT handling breaking, consequently
	discarding WHERE clauses).

2005-12-21  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Fixed bug #1781 to allow easier install.
	* Closed bug #1204 as not reproducable. Probably rather a
	PHP/Apache bug than a DBAL bug.
	* Closed bug #1317 which has been fixed earlier. It was due
	to a msissing check for the incoming SQL (string/array) in the
	native part of exec_UPDATEquery().
	* Fixed parseFieldDef() t3lib_sqlparser to allow datatypes
	with just a trailing comma (like in "tyinytext," as opposed
	to "varchar(19)". This prevented installation of some
	extensions.
	* Fixed bug #2072.
	* Fixed bug #1206.
	* Fixed a bug with error logging and array queries (BLOB).
	* Prepared a fix for bug #1649, pending core list approval.
	* Fixed a bug in t3lib_page, getMultipleGroupsWhereClause()
	where double quotes were used to quote a literal for use in
	SQL. THIS IS MYSQL-ONLY! NEVER DO THIS! ALWAYS USE SINGLE
	QUOTES!

2005-06-07  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	Documentation update.

2005-05-19  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	Committed changes to go along with the library removal done
	earlier. Completed debug logging.

2005-02-07  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	Bringing the DBAL extension AS OF JANUARY 2005 into CVS.  Works
	pretty well, but still needs more work. A few optimizations are
	planned and some bugs in native mode need to be fixed. Checking
	this in is (similar to yesterday's commit) more for
	historic/archival reasons.  This version will NOT work with 3.7.x.
	You have been warned.

2005-02-06  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	Bringing the DBAL extension AS OF JULY 2004 into CVS. This is
	rather for historic purposes, more changes will follow in the near
	future.  This version was already a huge step forward, but it will
	not work as expected with 3.7.x or 3.8.x. You have been warned.
