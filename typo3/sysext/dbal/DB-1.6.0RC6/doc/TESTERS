HOW TO TEST PEAR DB

$Id$


INTRODUCTION
============

These are instructions for testing PEAR DB on a Windows machine using a
Cygwin Bash shell.  Adjust the paths and commands to match your system.
This configuration is used because these precise steps are known to work.

NOTE:  You must log on as a user which has permissions to modify the
contents of your PHP executable's directory.  This is necessary for both
configuring AND running the test system.


INSTALLATION
============

Obtain PHP's Test Framework
---------------------------
If you don't have PHP's test framework, you need to obtain it.  These
steps include changing the working directory, downloading run-tests.php
via CVS and copying the file into place.  Change the revision flag in the
CVS command as appropriate for your present version of PHP.

 cd c:/progra~1/php
 cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login   # password is phpfi
 cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co -r PHP_4_3 \
     -d test php-src/run-tests.php
 cp test/run-tests.php .

Obtain DB's Test Framework
--------------------------
Create a location to store the test scripts and your notes.  A location
separate from your CVS working directory for DB is desirable because
you don't want to inadvertently commit a file with your passwords in it.
Then obtain the test suite via CVS.

 mkdir c:/dbtests
 cd c:/dbtests
 cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co -d tests pear/DB/tests

Copy and Edit DSN's
-------------------
setup.inc contains the DSN's for connecting to your test databases.
Creating a copy of it is helpful in case you download an updated version
of the test suite.  Make sure only one line is uncommented at a time.

 cp tests/driver/setup.inc .
 vi setup.inc &
 cp setup.inc tests/driver


RUN THE TESTS
=============

Set the Environment Variable
----------------------------
Set the path and file name of your PHP CLI executable.

 TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE=c:/progra~1/php/cli/php.exe
 export TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE

Execute Tests
-------------
Use complete paths to ensure the correct files are being accessed.  Use
the CLI version of PHP.  To run all of the tests in the directory:

 cd tests/driver
 c:/progra~1/php/cli/php.exe c:/progra~1/php/run-tests.php \
     c:/dbtests/tests/driver

To run one test, name the .phpt file specifically:

 c:/progra~1/php/cli/php.exe c:/progra~1/php/run-tests.php \
     c:/dbtests/tests/driver/02fetch.phpt

Test Types and Locations
------------------------
tests             Common PEAR DB tests
tests/driver      Common tests for all the drivers
tests/<backend>   Specific backend tests (old tests, don't used them)

Results and What To Do With Them
--------------------------------
Each test that fails generates a .php (which you can execute), a .exp
(the expected output), a .out (the test output) and a .diff (a diff -u
from the .exp and .out files).

If you run the tests, please report or fill the TEST CONFORMANCE table
in the STATUS document.  Before any commit to CVS be sure to run the
tests and nothing got broken with the change.

If you get the message "SKIP", means that the test it's not executed.
Look at the DB/tests/driver/skipif.inc to see what's the problem
(probably a connection problem).
