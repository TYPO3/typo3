# HEADS UP:
# This file is intended for NON install tool context services only.
# Therefore all services in this file are registered explictily and an
# include-all directive like `resource: '../Classes/*'` avoided on purpose.
#
# All *regular* EXT:install services are registered in
# TYPO3\CMS\Install\ServiceProvider instead to be usable without DI caches.
