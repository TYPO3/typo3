		</f:else>

	<h4>How to configure TYPO3 CMS</h4>
	<p>
		Local configuration is done by overriding default values in the
		file typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php. The options that you
		choose in the Install Tool will be saved in this file, such as database information
		and values in the global array
		TYPO3_CONF_VARS.
		<br /><br />
		If you wish to manually edit the file, the options in the TYPO3_CONF_VARS array
		and how to use them for your own purposes are discussed in the base configuration file,
		EXT:core/Configuration/DefaultConfiguration.php. This file sets up the default values,
		then includes the LocalConfiguration.php file to override the default values.
		<br />

	<h4>Using this script</h4>
	<p>
		These are the primary steps for you to take:
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>1: Important actions</strong>
		<br />
		This step provides an overview of the main system information
		(operating system, PHP information and database).
		<br />
		The following actions are available here:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Database Analyzer</strong> - compares the database table and field definitions of the
				current database with the specification from all loaded extensions' ext_tables.sql files.</li>
			<li><strong>Clear all cache</strong> - works similar to the cache clearing in the backend, but
				takes a more straightforward approach and the according backend hooks are not executed.</li>
			<li><strong>Check for broken extensions</strong> - checks whether the local extensions' ext_tables
				and ext_localconf files can be included without errors, meaning they can be loaded without
				breaking the system.</li>
			<li><strong>Core update</strong> - automatically update the TYPO3 CMS core to its latest bugfix
				release if certain criteria are met. <strong>Note:</strong> This is not supported on Windows hosts.</li>
			<li><strong>Change install tool password</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Change site name</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Change encryption key</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Create backend administrator user</strong> - you should use this function only if there
				are no admin users in the database, for instance if this is a blank database</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>2: Configuration presets</strong>
		<br />
		The following configuration preset groups are available here:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Character set conversion settings</strong> - charset conversion.</li>
			<li><strong>Development / Production settings</strong> - context can be defined with the environment
				variable "TYPO3_CONTEXT" which is usually set through your webserver configuration
				(e.g. in htaccess).</li>
			<li><strong>Image handling settings</strong> - this module detects the available image handling
				tools and configures the system.</li>
			<li><strong>Extbase object cache</strong> - choose between APC / Database cache backend</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>3: All configuration</strong>
		<br />
		In this step you can change the configuration values of your TYPO3 CMS installation.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>4: Upgrade Wizard</strong>
		<br />
		If you upgrade your TYPO3 CMS installation from one version to another (e.g. 6.1 to 6.2),
		then the Upgrade Wizards guide you through the necessary steps to upgrade your database records
		or explicitly install extensions that ship with the latest TYPO3 CMS version.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>5: System environment</strong>
		<br />
		In this step your system environment is checked. If there are any settings that will prevent TYPO3 CMS from
		running correctly, you'll get warnings and errors with a description of the problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>6: Folder structure</strong>
		<br />
		This step checks the folder structure of your TYPO3 CMS installation and fixes errors that you might have
		with files or folders.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>7: Test setup</strong>
		<br />
		This gives you a set of tests for your TYPO3 CMS installation in order to test system settings:
		<ul>
			<li>Mail setup</li>
			<li>True type font dpi settings</li>
			<li>Convert image formats to jpg</li>
			<li>Writing gif and png</li>
			<li>Scaling images</li>
			<li>Combining images</li>
			<li>GDlib</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>8: Clean up</strong>
		<br />
		Here you can clean up temporary files in the typo3temp/ folder and the database tables used for
		caching. Furthermore you can reset the preferences of all backend users.
	</p>
