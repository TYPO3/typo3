                TYPO3 features a flexible caching system with a default configuration that is ideal for most use cases.
                Depending on your individual hosting setup, the performance of your TYPO3 instance can be optimized even further
                by adjusting the storage type below.
            </p>
            <p>
                Storing the caches in the database is usually the best choice for standard environments as well as for
                installations where a network file system (NFS) is used and file system access impacts the performance and
                should be avoided (high disk I/O).
                The file-based storage for TYPO3 caches is more efficient in shared hosting environments or if a distributed
                database is used.
                For more complex, high-end installations, memory-based caches such as Redis or Memcached should be considered
                which require additional configuration in &quot;system/settings.php&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                To configure the storage type for each cache independently, custom cache settings can be configured.
