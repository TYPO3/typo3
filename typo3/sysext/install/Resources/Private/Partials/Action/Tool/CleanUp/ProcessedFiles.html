<p>
	The File Abstraction Layer stores a database record for every file it needs to process. (e.g. image thumbnails)
	In case you modified some graphics settings (All Configuration [GFX]) and you need all processed files to get
	regenerated, you can use this tool to remove the existing ones. The new processed files are created once they are
	needed.
