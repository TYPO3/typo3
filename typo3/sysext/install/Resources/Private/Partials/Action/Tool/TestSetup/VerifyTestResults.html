		This page performs image processing and displays the result. It's a thorough check
		that everything you've configured is working correctly.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's quite simple to verify your installation; Just look down the page, the images
		in pairs should look like each other. If some images are not alike, something is
		wrong. You may also notice warnings and errors if this tool found signs of any problems.

		The image to the left is the reference image (how it should be) and to the right
		the image made by your server.
