Installation with Composer
==========================

Check whether you are already using the extension with:

..  code-block:: bash

    composer show | grep rte

This should either give you no result or something similar to:

..  code-block:: none

    typo3/cms-rte-ckeditor       v12.4.11

If it is not installed yet, use the ``composer require`` command to install
the extension:

..  code-block:: bash

    composer require typo3/cms-rte-ckeditor

The given version depends on the version of the TYPO3 Core you are using.

not be activated yet. Activate it as follows:

#.  In the backend, navigate to the :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Extensions`
    module.
