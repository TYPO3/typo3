Settings editor
===============

When the :ref:`site set for the frontend login <configuration-site-set>` is included,
the settings for EXT:felogin become available in the editor.

You can find the available site settings in module
:guilabel:`Sites > Setup > Settings`

You can change individual settings here. If the site settings are writable
you can hit the :guilabel:`Save` button and the settings will be written
directly to the site settings.

If the settings are not writable you can click the :guilabel:`YAML export`
button to export the settings. These can then be added by a developer with
sufficient rights.

The available settings are also described in detail in
:ref:`configuration-site-set-settings`.
