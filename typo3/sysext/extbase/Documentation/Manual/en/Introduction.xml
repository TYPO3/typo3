  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>FLOW3 is a PHP-based application framework. It is especially
  well-suited for enterprise-grade applications and explicitly supports
  Domain-Driven Design, a powerful software design philosophy. Convention over
  configuration, Test-Driven Development, Continuous Integration and an
  easy-to-read source code are other important principles we follow for the
  development of FLOW3.</para>

  <para>Although we created FLOW3 as the foundation for the TYPO3 Content
  Management System, its approach is general enough to be useful as a basis
  for any other PHP application. We're happy to share the FLOW3 framework with
  the whole PHP community and are looking forward to the hundreds of new
  features and enhancements contributed as packages by other enthusiastic
  developers. In fact most of the packages which will be developed for the
  TYPO3 CMS can be used in any other FLOW3-based application. In essence this
  reflects the vision of the TYPO3 project: "Inspiring People to
  Share".</para>

  <para>This reference describes all features of FLOW3 and provides you with
  in-depth information. If you'd like to get a feeling for FLOW3 and get
  started quickly, we suggest that you try out our Getting Started tutorial
  first.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Please note that FLOW3 is still under heavy development. Although we
    hope that the documentation is at least accurate and up to date, it is by
    no means complete and most likely not proof-read. If you find errors or
    would like to help us improving the documentation, we're happy to hear
    from you on our mailing list!</para>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis>Error</emphasis> module handles errors and

        custom validation of any object.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis>Property</emphasis> module implements the concept
        of property editors and is used for setting and retrieving object
        properties.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis>Reflection</emphasis> API complements PHP's
        built-in reflection support by advanced annotation handling and a
        cached reflection service.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis>AOP</emphasis> Framework enables you to use the

      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis>Persistence</emphasis> module allows you to
        transparently persist your objects following principles of
        <emphasis>Domain Driven Design</emphasis>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis>Security</emphasis> Framework enforces security
        policies and provides an API for managing those.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis>Locale</emphasis> service manages languages and
        other regional settings and makes them accessible to other packages
        and FLOW3 sub packages.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis>Utility</emphasis> module is a library of useful
        general-purpose functions for file handling, algorithms, environment
        abstraction and more.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If you are overwhelmed by the amount of information in this
    reference, just keep in mind that you don't need to know all of it to
    write your own FLOW3 packages. You can always come back and look up a
    specific topic once you need to know about it - that's what references are
    for. But even if you don't need to know everything, we recommend that you
    get familiar with the concepts of each module and read the whole manual.
    This way you make sure that you don't miss any of the great features FLOW3
    provides and hopefully feel inspired to produce clean and
    easy-maintainable code.</para>
