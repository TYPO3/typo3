	"description": "The recycler offers the possibility to restore deleted records or remove them from the database permanently. These actions can be applied to a single record, multiple records, and recursively to child records (ex. restoring a page can restore all content elements on that page). Filtering by page and by table provides a quick overview of deleted records before taking action on them.",
