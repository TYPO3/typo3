=======================================
TYPO3 CMS Recycler (typo3/cms-recycler)
=======================================

Restore deleted records or remove them from the database permanently.

These actions can be applied to a single record,
multiple records, and recursively to child records (ex. restoring a page can
restore all content elements on that page). Filtering by page and by table
provides a quick overview of deleted records before taking action on them.
