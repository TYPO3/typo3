=============================
Recycler (typo3/cms-recycler)
=============================

The recycler offers the possibility to restore deleted records or remove them
from the database permanently. These actions can be applied to a single record,
multiple records, and recursively to child records (ex. restoring a page can
restore all content elements on that page). Filtering by page and by table
provides a quick overview of deleted records before taking action on them.
