This extension allows you to restore deleted records or permanently remove them
from the database.

These actions can be applied to a single record, multiple records, and
recursively to child records, for example, restoring a page can restore all
content items on that page. Filtering by page and table provides a quick
overview of deleted records before taking further action.
