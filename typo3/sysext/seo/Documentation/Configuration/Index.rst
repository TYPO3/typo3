TypoScript Settings
===================

There are a couple of TypoScript settings that can influence the output regarding search engine optimization.

* `config.pageTitleFirst <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/master/en-us/Setup/Config/Index.html#pagetitlefirst>`__
* `config.pageTitleSeparator <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/master/en-us/Setup/Config/Index.html#pagetitleseparator>`__
* `config.pageTitleProviders <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/master/en-us/Setup/Config/Index.html#pagetitleproviders>`__
* `config.noPageTitle <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/master/en-us/Setup/Config/Index.html#nopagetitle>`__

Site configuration
==================

From version 9 of TYPO3, the configuration of sites is done with the Site Management module. As the settings for
your websites are important for SEO purposes as well, please make sure you check the following fields.

.. figure:: ../Images/site.png
   :class: with-shadow
   :alt: example site

   Example site

To get more in depth information about the site handling please refer to the :ref:`t3coreapi:sitehandling` docs.

Domains
-------

Please ensure, that you have configured your sites so that they all have an entry point. This is used for
generating the canonical tags, for example.

.. warning::

   Please be aware that for SEO purposes it is best practise to use a fully qualified domain (for example: https://www.example.com).
   Therefor we don't support the SEO enhancements in TYPO3 without a full domain. It might work, but it is not officially
   supported.

Language
--------

Ensure, that you setup the languages correctly. All languages should have the right information in the :guilabel:`Locale`
and :guilabel:`Language Tag` field. When set correctly, TYPO3 will automatically connect your page in the different languages
for search engines. This it to ensure that the search engine knows which page to show when someone is searching in a
specific language.

.. hint::

   Even if you have only one language, make sure your :guilabel:`Locale` and :guilabel:`Language Tag` fields are set correctly.
   Giving wrong information to search engines will not help you to rank higher.

See :ref:`t3coreapi:sitehandling-addingLanguages` for more details.

Error pages
-----------

Although TYPO3 will respond with a HTTP status code 404 (Not found) when a page is not found, it is best practise to
have a proper message telling the user that the page they requested is not available and to guide them to another
page or for example to a search function of your website.

See :ref:`t3coreapi:sitehandling-errorHandling` for more details.

robots.txt
----------

The robots.txt is a powerful tool and should be used with care. It will deny or allow search engines to access your pages.
By blocking access to your pages, search engines won't crawl these pages. You should make sure that this will not
prevent the search engines from finding important pages.

It is best practise to keep your robots.txt as clean as possible. An example of a minimal version of your robots.txt:

.. code-block:: php

   # This space intentionally left blank. Only add entries when you know how powerful the robots.txt is.
   User-agent: *

On :ref:`t3coreapi:sitehandling-staticRoutes` you can find more details on how to create a static route that will show
this information when visiting https://www.example.com/robots.txt.

When you want to disallow specific URLs, you can use the :ref:`index-page` option in the backend or set the robot HTTP
header `X-Robots-tag` manually.

Redirects
---------

Having correct redirects is a very important part of SEO. Especially the status code that is used for redirects is
really important. Please use the appropriate status code for your use case.

Example

As there are no explanation for wildcard redirects in the external resources:
trying to redirect old realulr URLs which all ends with `.html` to the new generic form you have to create a redirect with:
Source Path[source_path] = `/(.+)\.html/`
Target[target] = `https://www.domain.tld/$1`
Is regular expression?[is_regexp] = checked

.. _config-tags:

Tags
====

.. _config-hreflang-tags:

Hreflang Tags
-------------

The generation of the :html:`<link rel="alternate" hreflang="" href="" />`
tags is done automatically if the page is available in other languages.
This feature should work correctly in almost all cases.

TYPO3 is using PSR-14 events to handle the generation of those hreflang tags.
If, for some reason, you would like to alter or remove the automatically generated
tags, you can register your own EventListener. This EventListener should listen
to the :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Event\ModifyHrefLangTagsEvent` event. Just make
sure your EventListener is ordered after the :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Seo\HrefLang\HrefLangGenerator`
listener.

More information how to work with EventListeners can be found in the documentation of :ref:`t3coreapi:EventDispatcher`

.. _config-canonical-tag:

Canonical Tag
-------------

Just like the hreflang tags, the :html:`<link rel="canonical" href="" />` tag is also generated automatically.
If you have a specific edge case, and you don't want TYPO3 to render the tag, you can disable rendering completely.
You just have to put this line in the :file:`ext_localconf.php` of an extension and make sure your extension is loaded after EXT:seo.

.. code-block:: php

   unset($GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Page\PageGenerator']['generateMetaTags']['canonical']);

Working links
=============

Links in your website are quite important. You can use third party applications to check all your links, but you can
also use the core extension linkvalidator to ensure, all the links in your site are working as expected.

Please check the documentation of :ref:`linkvalidator:start` .

TypoScript examples
===================

This section will provide you examples on how to configure several behaviours in the frontend.

Setting missing OpenGraph tags
------------------------------

Most of the OpenGraph tags are rendered automatically when EXT:seo is installed. If you
want to add other fields as og:title, og:description and og:image, you can use some
TypoScript code like this:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   page {
     meta {
       og:site_name = YOUR_SITE_NAME
       og:site_name.attribute = property

       og:locale = en_US
       og:locale.attribute = property
       og:locale:alternate {
         attribute = property
         value {
            1 = de_DE
         }
       }
     }
   }

Setting fallbacks for meta tags
-------------------------------
As you can see on :ref:`t3coreapi:metatagapi-configuration` the tags are first
set by PHP and after that the TypoScript config is handled. As EXT:seo is only
adding the meta tags for the SEO and Social Media fields if they are filled in
the page properties, you have some possibilities to add fallbacks.

Because the EXT:seo is handling the tags by PHP, you are able to add those
fallbacks by TypoScript. You can just add those tags by TypoScript and those will
only be rendered when EXT:seo will not render it.

An example to set a fallback description and og:description:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   page {
     meta {
       description = Your fallback description tag
       og:description = Your fallback OG:description tag
     }
   }

.. hint::

   Having fallbacks for those fields seems to be a good idea, but please consider
   if you really want those fallbacks. Those meta tags should tell search engines
   or social networks, what the page is about. Social networks also have their own
   fallbacks. Setting a fallback for og:description to the description field might
   not be needed as the social networks have such a fallback as well. So please consider
   if you want to add those tags if they does not bring additional information.

Setting fallbacks for og:image and twitter:image
------------------------------------------------

If you want to have a fallback og:image or twitter:image, you can use this little snippet.

.. code-block:: typoscript

   page {
     meta {
       og:image.stdWrap.cObject = TEXT
       og:image.stdWrap.cObject {
         if.isFalse.field = og_image
         stdWrap.typolink {
           parameter.stdWrap.cObject = IMG_RESOURCE
           parameter.stdWrap.cObject.file = EXT:your_extension/Resources/Public/Backend/OgImage.svg
           returnLast = url
           forceAbsoluteUrl = 1
         }
       }
       twitter:image.stdWrap.cObject = TEXT
       twitter:image.stdWrap.cObject {
         if.isFalse.field = twitter_image
         stdWrap.typolink {
           parameter.stdWrap.cObject = IMG_RESOURCE
           parameter.stdWrap.cObject.file = EXT:your_extension/Resources/Public/Backend/TwitterCardImage.svg
           returnLast = url
           forceAbsoluteUrl = 1
         }
       }
     }
   }

More information about the Meta Tag Api can be found on:

* PHP :ref:`t3coreapi:metatagapi`
* TypoScript :ref:`t3tsref:meta`

Setting defaults for the author on meta tags
--------------------------------------------

This example shows how to set a default author based on the TypoScript constant :ts:`{$my.default.author}`:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   page {
     meta {
       author = {$my.default.author}
     }
   }
