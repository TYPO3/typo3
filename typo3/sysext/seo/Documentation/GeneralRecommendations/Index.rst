Recommendations for additional seo extensions
=============================================

The TYPO3 core ships the whole API and the needed fields to have all necessary technical SEO.

Besides that, there are lots of tools you can use to optimize your rankings.

If you install additional SEO extensions in TYPO3 make sure you check the following recommendations:

* The extension **should** stick to the core fields where possible
* The extension **should** stick to the core behaviour where possible
* The extension **could** extend TCA with additional helpers for your editors, like:

  * Readability checks
  * Keyword and content checks
  * Previews
  * Page speed insights

Some of these tools might need external services, others can work completely on-premise.
