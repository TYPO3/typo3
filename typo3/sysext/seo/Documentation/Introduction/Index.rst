Introduction
============

The goal of the Core extension :composer:`typo3/cms-seo` is to make sure basic
technical Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is done right out of the box.
Specific fields for SEO purposes are added, as well as the rendering of HTML
meta tags in the frontend.

There are several things you can do to optimize your site for search engines.
Some tasks are only solvable with good human writers, others are technical
tasks, which need to be implemented.

The goal of the extension `seo` is to help you with the following parts of
your SEO journey.

*   Give editors all the fields needed to set the necessary meta tags.
*   Provide the rendering of meta tags in the frontend for SEO related
    information, to avoid reimplementing it again and again.
*   Provide stable APIs for developers to give them the chance to change the
    behaviour when needed in edge cases.
