        <source>Selecting the module will display the page tree.  Click the title of the page you wish to edit content on, and in the right frame you will see the content of the page displayed by the Page module.

The page module has various modes of display of content;

&lt;b&gt;Columns&lt;/b&gt;
The columns view will show Content Elements listed in the columns and in the order that they will appear on the website. A panel of buttons will allow you to hide/unhide, move and edit the elements easily.

&lt;b&gt;QuickEdit&lt;/b&gt;
In QuickEdit the first element on the page will be loaded into a form right away. It will depend on the implementation of your website as well as your general preferences if you like this mode more than the columns view.

&lt;b&gt;Languages&lt;/b&gt;
If your site supports multiple languages and uses the "one-tree-fits-all" concept for localization you will need this mode to control the translations of the content elements on a page.

&lt;b&gt;Page information&lt;/b&gt;
The page information view shows some statistical data about a page. This includes hit statistics if available.


&lt;b&gt;General options&lt;/b&gt;
In the top of the Page module you will find a row of icons that will bring you right to various features such as History/Undo (1), Create new content element (2), Move page (3), Create new page (4) and Edit page properties (5). See image below.

&lt;b&gt;Defining number of displayed columns [Admin]&lt;/b&gt;
Administrators can configure the Page module to display only the content columns that the website uses. This is done by Page TSconfig (so it can be configured per branch in the page tree!) and this particular option has the object path "mod.web_layout.tt_content.colPos_list".
For instance "mod.web_layout.tt_content.colPos_list = 0,3" will set the display of the "Normal" and "Border" columns only.
There are many other options for customization of the Page module in the object path "mod.web_layout" and Administrators should refer to the "TSconfig" reference linked to below.</source>
