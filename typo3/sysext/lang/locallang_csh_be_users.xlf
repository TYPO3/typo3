				<source>This is the table of backend administration users. Backend users can login in the backend of TYPO3 and are typically producers of content on a website.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id=".details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>The main settings for a backend user is a username, password and group memberships. The username and password authenticates the user to the system. The group memberships enables the user to perform actions in TYPO3 since groups are the main source of permission settings for a backend user.
Backend usergroups can also be understood as "roles". A usergroup can contain a configuration of permissions which allows the user to play a certain role in the system.

&lt;b&gt;The "Admin" user&lt;/b&gt;
There is a special kind of user, the "Admin" user. This user has access to everything in TYPO3. There are no limits for Admin-users at all. You should normally have only a single or two admin-users in your system.
Admin-users are the only users who can create other backend users. Alternatively you can create an "Action" which enables other normal users to do it as well (with certain restrictions of course).

&lt;b&gt;Location&lt;/b&gt;
Backend users are always created in the root of the page tree (like Backend groups are).

&lt;b&gt;Comparing Users&lt;/b&gt;
To manage and compare users, getting an overview of their access credentials etc. you can use the Tools &gt; User Admin module (extension: beuser). It allows you to group users by various categories of permissions. You can also switch to another users account by a single click of a button.</source>

			<trans-unit id="password.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>The password is required. Before the password is sent to the server it's md5-hashed, so the password value itself is not transferred over the Internet. This is true both when editing the password and when the user logs in.
While this principle does not reveal the raw password it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the same as real encryption. If you need the highest degree of security you should install the TYPO3 backend on a secure server.
The password is stored in the database as an md5-hash and thus it's not possible to extract the original password from the database either. This means that 'lost passwords' must be substituted with a new password for the user.

&lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt;
When you enter the password in the password field it is initially visible in clear text! First when the password field focus is lost will the password become a "list of dots".

&lt;b&gt;User changing password&lt;/b&gt;
Users can change their password from the User &gt; Setup module</source>

				<source>The backend user groups defines the permissions which the backend user will inherit. So unless the backend user is an 'Admin' user, he needs to be a member of one or more user groups in order to have practically any permissions assigned. The properties set in the user groups are mostly added together.
The first (top) group in the list is the group which will, by default, be the owner of pages the user creates.</source>

				<source>'Admin' can do anything TYPO3 allows and this kind of user should be used only for administrative purposes. All daily handling should be done with regular users.
'Admin' users don't need to be members of any backend user groups. However you should be aware that any page created by an admin user without a group will not have any owner-group assigned and thus it will probably be invisible for other users. If this becomes a problem you can easily solve it by assigning a user group to the 'Admin' user anyway. This does of course not affect the permissions since they are unlimited, but the first group listed is by default the owner group of newly created pages.
'Admin' users are easily recognized as they appear with a red icon instead of the ordinary blue user-icon.

You should probably not assign any other users than yourself as an 'Admin' user.</source>
