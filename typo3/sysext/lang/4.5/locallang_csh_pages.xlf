        <source>The pages' table is the backbone of TYPO3. All records editable by the main modules in TYPO3 must belong to a page. It's exactly like files and folders on your computer's hard drive.

&lt;b&gt;The Pagetree&lt;/b&gt;
The pages are organized in a tree structure that reflects the organization of your website.

&lt;p&gt;UID, PID and the Pagetree Root&lt;/b&gt;
All database elements have a field 'uid' which is a unique identification number. They also have a field 'pid' (page id) which holds the ID number of the page to which they belong. If the 'pid' field is zero, the record is found in the 'root.' Only administrators are allowed access to the root. Table records must be configured to either belong to a page or be found in the root.

&lt;b&gt;Storage of Database Records&lt;/b&gt;
Depending on the 'Type,' a page may also represent general storage for database elements in TYPO3. In this case, it is not available as a webpage but is used internally in the Pagetree as a place to store items such as users, subscriptions, etc. Such pages are typically of the type "Folder".</source>
