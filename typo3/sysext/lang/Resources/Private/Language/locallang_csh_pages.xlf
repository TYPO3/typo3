				<source>A 'Page' record usually represents a webpage in TYPO3. All pages have an ID number (UID) by which they can be linked and referenced. The 'Page' record itself does not contain the content of the page. 'Page Content' records (Content Elements) are used for this.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id=".details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>The 'pages' table is the backbone of TYPO3. All records editable by the main modules in TYPO3 must belong to a page. It's exactly like files and folders on your computer's hard drive.

&lt;b&gt;The Page Tree&lt;/b&gt;
The pages are organized in a tree structure that reflects the organization of your website.

&lt;b&gt;UID, PID and the page tree root&lt;/b&gt;
All database elements have a field 'uid' which is a unique identification number. They also have a field 'pid' (page id) which holds the ID number of the page to which they belong. If the 'pid' field is zero, the record is found in the 'root.' Only administrators are allowed access to the root. Table records must be configured to either belong to a page or be found in the root.

&lt;b&gt;Storage of Database Records&lt;/b&gt;
Depending on the 'Type', a page may also represent general storage for database elements in TYPO3. In this case, it is not available as a webpage but is used internally in the page tree as a place to store items such as users, subscriptions, etc. Such pages are typically of the type "Folder".</source>

				<source>The most basic fields on a page are the 'Disable Page' option, the 'Type' of page ("doktype") and the 'Page Title'.
Pages are arranged in a page tree in TYPO3. The page from the editing form in the previous screenshot was the "Intro" page from this page tree. As you can see it belongs in the root of the page tree and has a number of subpages pages under it.</source>

				<source>The 'Page Title' is used to represent the page visually in the system, for example in the page tree. Also the 'Page Title' is used by default for navigation links on webpages.
You can always change the 'Page Title' without affecting links to a page. This is because pages are always referenced by ID number, not their title.
You can use any characters in the 'Page Title'.</source>

				<source>'Standard' is the most common page type and is used for normal webpages.
'Folder' is a page type which is not shown as a webpage; instead, it stores records of your choice.
'Recycler' is a garbage can. Pages and records in a recycler are not visible in the frontend.

&lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt; Each page type is represented by a unique icon. The available page types can be restricted for users so all of the options described above may not be visible. Finally, some records may only be allowed on certain page types, but any record can be placed in a 'Folder.'

&lt;b&gt;$PAGES_TYPES [Technical]&lt;/b&gt;
The restrictions that apply to each page type is defined in the global array $PAGES_TYPES. When extensions add tables to TYPO3 they may need to register their tables in $PAGES_TYPES so they can be created on standard pages.</source>

				<source>'TypoScript' is a concept for entering values in a hierarchical structure that is used to create templates for TYPO3 websites.
The same principles of storing a hierarchy of values is also used to configure various Backend functionality such as Modules and the RTE.
The 'TSconfig' for an individual page is actually an accumulation of all 'TSconfig' values beginning from the root page and trickling downward to the current page. This means the TSconfig on the current page will affect all of its subpages as well. All TSconfig in use on a page is available from the 'Page TSconfig' menu in the 'Web&gt;Info' Module (requires the "info_pagetsconfig" extension to be installed).</source>
