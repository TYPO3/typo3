				<source>TYPO3 is a Content Management Framework which consists of a central program core with only limited functionality. To extend this core system there are hundreds of extensions which in combination will provide a very capable system.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id=".details">
				<source>For most people TYPO3 is equivalent to a CMS providing a backend for management of the content and a frontend engine for website display. However TYPO3s core is natively designed to be a general purpose framework for management of database content. The core of TYPO3 delivers a set of principles for storage of this content, user access management, editing of the content, uploading and managing files etc. Many of these principles are expressed as an API (Application Programmers Interface) for use in the &lt;em&gt;extensions&lt;/em&gt; which ultimately adds most of the real functionality.</source>

				<source>Backend Users might see different menu items depending on their access permissions. The "Admin" user on a system will always see all modules available.

You can configure the backend to display the menu in two alternative versions (useful on smaller screens); As a selector box or list of icons in the top frame of the backend.

When you click the little "+" or "-" icons next to the main modules, you can collapse (-) or expand (+) all the sub modules. By selecting the "Expand all" check box, all items are expanded. When the checkbox is unselected again, the menu changes back to the previous folding state. If you click "Expand all" and collapse a main module afterwards, the previous folding state is discarded and "Expand all" is unselected again.</source>

			<trans-unit id="menu_adminFunction.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>TYPO3 has multiple caching systems:

&lt;b&gt;Database Cache&lt;/b&gt;
A very central cache is the database cache table, "cache_hash", which needs to be flushed after certain major changes in the system. You "clear all cache" by clicking the link with the blue icon. After this operation any website content should be re-generated from the sources rather than be delivered from caches. This operation clears &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; database tables registered as flushable cache tables.

&lt;b&gt;Cached PHP configuration files from Extensions&lt;/b&gt;
TYPO3 also caches small configuration scripts from extensions, "ext_localconf.php" and "ext_tables.php". These files are simply read from all installed extensions and concatenated into temporary PHP scripts found in the typo3temp/Cache/Code/cache_core/ folder. Sometimes you need to remove these files so TYPO3 re-writes them from the originals. This is done by the "Clear temp_CACHED" link.

&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; You should not clear these caches without a second thought. Clearing caches may affect performance on your server negatively for a while. Obviously the cached content has to be regenerated which takes time and under heavy load it might make your server un-available for a while.</source>

			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="pagetree.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>The page tree works like a file system. Each page is like a directory where you can store files. In TYPO3 you store database records inside of each page. Some of these records, typically called "Content Elements", contains the website content of pages. Other records can be from plugins like a glossary or a guestbook and they are only displayed indirectly by a plugin inserted as a Content Element.
Some backend users will see only a part of the page tree for a website. This feature allows the administrator to configure backend users with different responsibilities for maintaining branches of the page tree.

&lt;b&gt;Navigating the tree&lt;/b&gt;
Simply click the +/- buttons to expand and contract the branches of the tree.
If you click the page icons you should see a context menu pop up. It will contain options specifically for that page.
Clicking the title of a page is another option. It will load the right frame of the Web main module with the selected sub-module. The content shown in the right frame will be related to the page clicked.</source>

			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="filetree.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>The Folder Tree is available for any sub-module of the File main module in TYPO3. The File module is like a little web-based FTP-client inside of TYPO3 which allows you to upload, rename, copy, move, delete and edit files inside TYPO3.
Most users of TYPO3 doesn't need access to the File module and sub-modules in order to upload images on web-pages. They can do this directly when editing Content Elements. But the File module is useful for maintaining collections of files on the server, for example an image archive or files for download.

&lt;b&gt;Navigating the Folder Tree&lt;/b&gt;
You can expand and contract the folder tree by the +/- icons.
Clicking a folder icon will display a pop-up menu with options related to that particular folder. Options include copy/cut/paste, rename, upload etc.
Clicking the folder title will load the currently active sub-module in the right frame of the backend. The sub-module will typically show files and folders inside the folder you clicked.

&lt;b&gt;Granting access to the Folder Tree&lt;/b&gt;
The administrator needs to allow backend users to access the File modules and in addition make a file mount available to them before they can use the Folder Tree.</source>

			<trans-unit id="list_module.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>The list module is like the file manager in an Operating System; it provides basic access to all "elements" available in the system. In TYPO3 almost all information is stored in the database and managed after the same principles internally. For instance Content Elements representing page content are database records just like backend users are. The Web&gt;List module allows us to create, modify and delete both kinds of records after the same principles.

The Web&gt;List module might not be the best "view" of the content on a page for any situation. For instance if you want to manage website content on a page (Content Elements) you should rather use the "Web&gt;Page" module which is designed to display content elements more optimized. But the List module will always give you access to whatever is on the page in a basic way if no better module is available for management.

&lt;b&gt;Single-table mode&lt;/b&gt;
If you click the tabel title in the listing you will enter single-table mode. In this mode you can select additional fields from the table to show in the listing. Also you will get additional editing facilities, for instance you will be able to edit multiple records at a time and even only certain fields from those records. See the screenshot for more details.</source>

If you click the Info icon you will see in detail what the difference is from current time to this state of the element.

			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="TCEforms.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>&lt;b&gt;Saving content&lt;/b&gt;
Just press one of the save-buttons in the top of bottom of the form. There are some variants allowing you to "Save and close document" or "Save document and View page". The latter will save the document and open a new window where the affected page is shown (be sure to disable pop-up blockers for this function!)

&lt;b&gt;Editing multiple records at a time&lt;/b&gt;
From the Web&gt;List module you can activate editing of multiple records at a time. This is done when you list a single table and enable multiple columns for display (see Web&gt;List module for details) - then icons will link you to a form with multiple records displayed, possibly with only certain fields available for editing.

&lt;b&gt;Frontend Editing&lt;/b&gt;
Another way of editing records in TYPO3 is using the website frontend. Depending on your user credentials you will see small pencil icons in the frontend. When you click these you will be guided to a form where you can also change the content.

&lt;b&gt;Customize the forms [for Admins]&lt;/b&gt;
You can customize the TCEforms in many ways using User TSconfig and Page TSconfig. See links below.</source>

The "additional fields" from the example above is located in a so called "palette". This is an example of three content elements being edited at the same time. You can edit multiple records by using the links from the Web&gt;List module in single-table mode. Notice that not only are three records shown at the same time - it is also a limited number of fields shown for editing, here "Header" and "Hide". You can combine this almost any way you like.

				<source>If the filenames you upload exist already they will be renamed with a numeric suffix, eg. "file_01.jpg". However you can avoid this behaviour if you select "Overwrite existing files" before pressing the "Upload" button.

Normally there is a limit to the size of files you can upload. By default PHP will allow you to upload around 2MB. TYPO3 is configured to allow 10MB internally by default. These settings can be changed by your server administrator if you need them changed.

Notice that file uploads may take a significant amount of time, even if you have fast internet access via DSL etc. If you have large amount of files you want to upload - or if the files are very large - you should consider using an FTP client instead. It depends not on TYPO3 but on the webserver whether this is an options for you.</source>

				<source>In order to create a shortcut it must be supported by the module you want to create the shortcut to. Whether shortcuts are supported can be seen in the bottom of a module. If there is a small "shortcut" icon you can click it to create the shortcut.

In the shortcut frame you can also enter a page id to edit in the "Edit Page ID" box. This will load the current page module with the id provided in the box.

Only "Admin"-users can access the shortcut frame in TYPO3 by default. Other users must have it enabled by the User TSconfig option, "options.shortcutFrame = 1". See link below for details (Admins).

Editing pages from an id is easy with the shortcut frame. Simply enter an integer number and that page will be loaded for editing. If you enter "[table]:[id]" then it will try to edit a record from the [table] table, for example "tt_content:123" will look for content element 123 (for admins only). Finally, if you enter a string that doesn't match a page or other record the Web&gt;List module will be invoked doing a search in the first database mount you have.</source>

				<source>There are two basic workspace types in TYPO3: The "Live" workspace and a number of "Draft" workspaces.
When working in the Live workspace all changes you make will take immediate effect. This is the default and traditional state of operation in TYPO3.
When working in the default Draft workspace or any customly created workspaces changes are not applied to the live website but rather made through new versions of any element editable. Since versioning doesn't apply to all elements in TYPO3 there are limitations to what can be done in draft workspaces; Only elements with versioning support can be edited and everything else is read-only. Draft workspaces allow preview in the frontend. When changes are final in a draft workspace they can be published into the live workspace.</source>
