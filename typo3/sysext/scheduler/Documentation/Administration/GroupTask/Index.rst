=======================================================
Grouping tasks together in the Scheduler backend module
=======================================================

In case of a high number of different tasks, it may be useful to visually group similar tasks together:

    Grouping related tasks together


Scheduler task groups are records stored on the root page (pid=0). They may be
created, edited and sorted with module :guilabel:`Web > List`:

    Management of scheduler task groups


It is also possible to create a new task group from within the edit task form by
clicking on the `+` icon next to the task group select box.

Individual tasks may then be edited as usual and associated to a given scheduler
task group.

The individual groups can be sorted independent of each other by clicking the column label.
With every click it switches between ascending and descending order of the items
of the associated column in the corresponding group.

..  note::
    Tasks inside a hidden group are neither automatically executed nor displayed
    in the scheduler module.
