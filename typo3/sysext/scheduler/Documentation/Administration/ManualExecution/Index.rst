===========================================================
Manually executing a task from the Scheduler backend module
===========================================================

As mentioned above, it is possible to manually execute one or more
registered tasks from the BE module. When the selected tasks have
finished running, feedback is given about success or failure of each
task's run. There's one important thing to note: if the task was
overdue, a new execution date will be calculated. If the task was
**not** overdue, the previously calculated next execution date stays.

A single task can be started by pressing the appropriate button in
the row of the task. Multiple tasks can be started by selecting the
checkboxes on the left side of the task row and then pressing the
appropriate button beneath the task list.

There is one button for directly starting the task and another button
for starting the task with the next cron job.
