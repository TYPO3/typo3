To-Do list
----------

Here are a few ideas for possible evolutions:

- check the possibility to use ``\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Locking\Locker`` instead of serialized
  executions to mark running tasks;

- use TCEform to render the edit form, instead of custom code;

- provide a way to register tasks automatically when an extension
  providing a task class is installed;

- deliver the Scheduler with more tasks, in particular some of the cron
  scripts from the TYPO3 Core.

Feature ideas or wishes can be entered into the Scheduler bug tracker
(http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-gabriel/issues/).
