Negative integer would indicate (abs value) number of groups. Eg "3" groups of 10 pages would be 1-4,5-8,9-10. Range is -100 to 100.

  # cat=basic; type=int; label=Full Text Data Length: If set, the full text data stored will be limited to this byte length. It means you can save some database space but to the degree you cut the length down you also limit possibilities to search for sentences and the search result resume will be limited.
