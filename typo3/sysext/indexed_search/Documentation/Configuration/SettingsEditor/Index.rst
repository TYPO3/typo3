    The new backend module :guilabel:`Site Management > Settings` provides an
    overview of sites which offer configurable settings and makes them editable.

When the :ref:`site sets of indexed_search are included <site-set>`,
the settings provided by those sets become available in the editor.

You can find the available site settings in module
:guilabel:`Site Management > Settings`

You can change individual settings here. If the site settings are writable
you can hit the :guilabel:`Save` button and the settings will be written
directly to the site settings.

If the settings are not writable you can click the :guilabel:`YAML export`
button to export the settings. These can then be added by a developer with
sufficient rights.

The available settings are also described in detail in chapter :ref:`site-set`.
