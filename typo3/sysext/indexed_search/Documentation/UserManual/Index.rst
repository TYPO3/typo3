Adding the search plugin to a page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That is really easy:

#. Create a page called "Search" or something like that. This is where
   the search box will appear.

#. Create a new content element on that page and choose the type
   "General Plugin".

#. Then choose the "Selected plugin" to be "Indexed search":

   :alt: Indexed Search plugin type

   Choosing "Indexed search" as a plugin type


That's it. Your frontend should now look like this:

.. figure:: ../Images/FrontendSearchForm.png
   :alt: Frontend search form

   Default view in the frontend, search form and rules help text


The styles are most likely different from this, but that is controlled
by the developer having administration access to the system.
