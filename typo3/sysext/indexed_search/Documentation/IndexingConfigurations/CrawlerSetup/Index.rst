Setting up the "crawler" extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you can work with "Indexing configurations" you must make sure
you have set up the "crawler" extension and have a cron-job running
that will process the crawler queue as we fill it! For this, please
refer to the `documentation of the "crawler" extension`__!
