				<source>Here you can check the integrity of the database tables configured by the $TCA. For instance all records must belong to a page record. In addition the existence of uploaded files attached to records (normally residing in uploads/* folders) are verified as well. You can also get a view of the total pagetree including deleted pages. Finally you've got access to a global database search facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Access for 'admin' users only!&lt;/em&gt;</source>
