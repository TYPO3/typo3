Welcome to our small dashboard introduction.
We will explain the basic usage of the TYPO3 dashboard.

..  _opening-dashboard:

Opening Dashboard
=================

By default the dashboard is opened when logging into the backend.

The dashboard can be opened at any time by clicking the entry
:guilabel:`Dashboard` in the module menu.

   Open the dashboard by clicking on :guilabel:`Dashboard`.

..  note::
    If the entry :guilabel:`Dashboard` is not visible in the menu there are two
    possible causes:

    *   You lack sufficient rights to view the dashboard.
    *   The system extension `dashboard` was not installed on your system.

    Ask your administrator about this.

..  _adding-dashboard:

Adding Dashboard
================

The EXT:dashboard allows to have multiple dashboards.
Switching between different dashboards is possible by using the corresponding tab.

In order to add further dashboards, press the :guilabel:`+` sign.

A wizard should open which allows to add the new dashboard.

There you can select a preset. At least the default preset, which is shipped
by core should be available. Depending on system configuration further dashboard
presets might be available.

Adding Widgets
==============

Widgets can be added to a dashboard.
Dashboards which do not contain any widget yet, offer a dialog in the middle of
the screen, which allows to add one or more widgets to the current dashboard.

All dashboards allow to add further widgets in the lower right corner through the
:guilabel:`+` Icon.
