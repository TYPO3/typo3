Standard TYPO3 content elements
===============================

Camino uses only a small number of standard TYPO3 content elements, these include:

*   Text
*   Text & Images
*   Form (used to embed forms created in the Forms module).
*   Login Form (used to access restricted areas in the frontend).

..  _custom-content-elements:

Custom content elements
=======================

Camino comes with new custom content elements that make it easy to add banners
and share links to third party platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

As discussed in the `Backend layouts <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/typo3/theme-camino:backend-layouts>`_
section, custom content elements can only be used in specific places. This also
applies to standard content elements.

For example, the `Page Header` content element can only be used in the
`Hero Section` of the `Start Page` backend layout and cannot be inserted into
the footer or any other section on the page.

Below is a list of all the custom content elements that ship with Camino.

..  _hero-header:

Hero page header, small & text only
-----------------------------------

These content elements create banners at the top of the page. Banners can include
a title, subheader, an image and a CTA (Call To Action) that links to another
page or an external source.

These three content elements can only be used in the `Hero Section` of the
`Start Page` backend layout.
