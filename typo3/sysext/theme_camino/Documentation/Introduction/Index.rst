Camino is the new responsive default theme that comes bundled with TYPO3 version
14.1 and higher.

The primary goal behind the Camino theme is to allow users to create a basic
website with a working frontend theme with zero setup.

Camino be customized - users can choose between three different backend layouts.
The colour scheme in the frontend can be changed and users can add their own logo.

The theme also comes with a range of content elements, including standard TYPO3
content elements and bespoke content elements created specifically for the
Camino theme.

Camino is currently a system extension. However, this will change in the near
future for TYPO3 version 15 where it will instead reside in the TYPO3 Extension
Repository(TER), Packagist and GitHub.

The theme will continue to receive updates and improvements up to TYPO3 14 LTS.

This guide will be updated as future releases of the Camino theme are made.

TYPO3 v15 will ship with a completely new theme under a different name.
