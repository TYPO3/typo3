Introduction

A webhook is an automated message sent from one application to another via HTTP.

This extension adds the possibility to configure webhooks in TYPO3.

The backend module :guilabel:`System > Webhooks` provides the possibility to
configure webhooks. The module is available in the TYPO3 backend for users with
administrative rights.

A webhook is defined as an authorized POST or GET request to a defined URL.
For example, a webhook can be used to send a notification to a Slack channel
when a new page is created in TYPO3.

Any webhook record is defined by a unique uid (UUID), a speaking name, an optional
description, a trigger, the target URL and a signing-secret.
Both the unique identifier and the signing-secret are generated in the backend
when a new webhook is created.
