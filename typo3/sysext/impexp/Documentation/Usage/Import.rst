   Make sure that any required extensions are installed and the database scheme
   is up-to-date before starting the import. Otherwise the data related
   to non-existing tables will not be imported.

   1. Go to the import module

      In the page tree, right-click the page you want to import to (1)
      and select :guilabel:`More options ... > Import` (2).

      .. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ContextMenuImport.rst.txt

   2. Upload the export file

      On the second tab of the import module you can upload the export file
      to your target TYPO3 instance.

      Select the file to upload (1) and click the :guilabel:`Upload files`
      button (2).

      Then switch to the :guilabel:`Import` tab (3).

      .. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/UploadImport.rst.txt

   3. Configure the import

      On the first tab of the import module you can configure the import.

      First select the uploaded export file (1). Then adjust the general
      settings (2). Finally, press the :guilabel:`Preview` button (3).

      Checking :guilabel:`Update records` means that existing records with the
      same UID will be updated instead of newly inserted.

      Checking :guilabel:`Do not show differences in records` prevents
      calculation of differences between existing and imported records.
      Note: The compare function is currently broken and therefore disabled in
      the screenshot.

   4. Check the data to be imported

      A tree with the records to be imported is displayed below the
      configuration form (1). If you change any of the options (2), you can
      reload this preview with the :guilabel:`Preview` button (3).

      .. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/CheckAndPerformImport.rst.txt

   5. Perform the import

      Click the :guilabel:`Import` button.
