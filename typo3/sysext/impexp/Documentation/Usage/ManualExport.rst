   1. Go to the export module

      On the page tree, left click on the page from where you want to start the
      export. Select :guilabel:`More options ...`:

      .. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ContextMenuMore.rst.txt

      Then select :guilabel:`Export` from the context menu.

      .. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ContextMenuExport.rst.txt

   2. Select the tables to be exported

      You can select the tables manually, from where
      you want to export the entries correlated with the selected page. It
      is also possible to include static relations to tables already present
      in the target installation.

      .. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ExportDialog.rst.txt

   3. Choose the number of levels to be exported

      If you want to save all your data, including subpages,
      select 'Infinite' from the :guilabel:`Levels` select box and hit the
      :guilabel:`Update` Button at the end of the dialog.

      .. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ExportDialogInfiniteLevels.rst.txt

   4. Check the included records

      All included pages can be seen at the top of the dialog. Below the
      dialog there is a detailed list of all the data to be exported. It is
      possible to exclude single records here. With some data types it
      is possible to make them manually editable.

      When the relation to records are lost these will be marked with an
      orange exclamation mark. Reasons for lost relations include records
      stored outside the page tree to be exported and excluded tables.

      tab :guilabel:`File & Preset`.
