Wizard settings
===============

The wizard basically consists of two parts on the screen, the left
"settings" part and the right "form" part. With TSconfig settings it
is possible to configure the contents of the left "settings" part. The
integrator can remove tabs, accordions or a specific setting for a single
type of form element, or for all element types at once.

The basic configuration has two settings: **defaults** and **elements**.
