        <source>This feature is useful when pasting text that was copied to the clipboard from some external source.

The "Clean paste" button allows to toggle to clean paste mode and back to normal paste mode.
Clicking on the "Clean paste" button puts the button "on". This action does not initiate any paste operation. But when the "clean paste" button is "on" in the RTE tool bar, whenever a paste operation is performed, content contained in the clipboard is transformed before being pasted into the editing area.
Clicking again on the toggle button puts it "off". Any subsequent paste operation is performed as a normal paste.</source>

        <source>When the "Clean paste" toggle is "on" in the RTE tool bar, the content may be tranformed according to the three following behaviours before being pasted:
- plain text: all HTML markup is removed;
- structure only: only structural HTML markup is retained, all format is removed;
- structure and basic format: structural HTML markup is preserved as well as basic format provided by inline HTML elements.

Which behaviour is activated when clicking the toggle button may be set either in the TYPO3 BE User Settings or in the "Clean Paste Behaviour" dialogue. If not set, it defaults to "Paste as plain text".
