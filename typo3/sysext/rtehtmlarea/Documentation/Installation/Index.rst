Installing the RTE
------------------

The extension is a system extension and is installed by default when
TYPO3 is installed.

Use the Extension Manager to un-install/re-install the extension.

The extension may be installed as a system, global or local extension.

If you plan to use the spell checking feature, you should install
extension Static Info Tables (static\_info\_tables). The spell checker
feature requires `GNU Aspell 0.60+ <http://aspell.net/>`_ to be
installed on the server.

Custom elements presented by the User Elements feature may be
maintained with extension `Custom Tags
<http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/search/de_custom_tags/>`_
(extension key: de\_custom\_tags).

Upon installation directory uploads/tx\_rtehtmlarea will be created.
Personal dictionaries are stored in subdirectories of this directory.
