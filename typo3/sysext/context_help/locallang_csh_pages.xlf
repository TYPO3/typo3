				<source>'Standard' and 'Advanced' types are regular webpages, just differing in the number of options.
'External URL' and 'Shortcut' types allows you to let a page be a shortcut to either an external URL or in the latter case a page in the page tree.
'Not in menu' is also a regular page, but will not be shown in the navigation. &lt;em&gt;This page type is deprecated! Please use the "Hide in menu" option!&lt;/em&gt;
'Backend User Section' is an option which requires a backend user to be logged in for the page to be visible.

&lt;b&gt;Special types:&lt;/b&gt;
'Spacer' is only meaningfull if your frontend navigation is programmed to use it. In this case it does not represent a page with content but is intended to be a non-clickable placeholder in the navigation.
'SysFolder' is a page type which cannot be shown as a webpage but is rather acting as a storage for records of your choice.
'Recycler' is a garbage can. Pages and records in a recycler are not visible in the frontend.

&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; Each type usually has a specific icon attached. Also certain types may not be available for a user (so you may experience that some of the options are not available for you!). And finally each type is configured to allow only certain table records in the page (SysFolder will allow any record if you have any problems).</source>

				<source>Consider a scenario where you want to create a whole section of subpages only visible for users which are logged in.

However the subpages would still be visible if one could guess the id-number of the pages and enter it manually in the URL. But setting this option would extend the effect of the top page setting to cover all subpages as well.</source>

			<trans-unit id="alias.description" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>An 'alias' is a unique identification string for a page. You can use this string instead of the id-number to refer to the page.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="alias.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>Ultimately a page is identified by its id-number. For instance you may refer to a page in TYPO3 by '.../?id=123'. If the page with id '123' has the alias 'one_two_three', then the URL '.../?id=one_two_three' would display exactly the same page, because 'one_two_three' is an alias for the id '123'.
Normally you should assign aliases only to a limited number of pages, preferably those you need to link to a lot. In most TYPO3 configurations you would be able to use the syntax '.. &amp;lt;link one_two_three&amp;gt;go to the page&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt; ..' to create a link to the page. This is easier to remember.
Another use is if you need to change which page such a link is referring to. In that case you can delete the alias for one page and enter it for another and all links pointing to the alias would now refer to another id-number.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="alias.syntax" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>An alias can contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters and must be unique.
Please notice: If the entered value was not unique, it will automatically be prepended with a number.</source>

			<trans-unit id="target.description" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>The HTML target of menu items linking to this page. Also can be used for open page in popup.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="target.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>Set this value only to overrule the default link, which should be configured correctly for most pages in the website TypoScript template.
There are more options with the target field

Setting an integer value at the start of the field adds it as the default type for the page.
For example, if an RSS feed is configured in Typoscript as typeNum=100, setting the target to 100 could be used to add an RSS link in the menu.

For open in popup use following syntax:
400x200 - this opens page in a popup of size 400x200
230x450:resizable=0,location=1 - opens page in popup with parameters

Combined:
100 600x350 - opens page in popup with type 100
2 _blank - opens page with target "_blank" and type 2</source>

			<trans-unit id="no_cache.description" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>This option disables server caching of the page.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="no_cache.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>Normally pages in TYPO3 are cached on the server after being constructed for the first time. This means a page is displayed much faster the second time it's requested.
For most pages this presents no problems - rather it's boosting the performance of the website.
However you may need to disable caching for a page if it contains dynamic content which must not be cached under any circumstances. Normally the PHP-code rendering such content is programmed to disable the caching automatically. But in any case you can force the page not to be cached via this option.</source>

			<trans-unit id="module.description" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>Define the page as a frontend 'module'.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="module.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>In the backend there is a module called 'Web&gt;Modules' as well as a header 'Modules' in the 'User&gt;Task Center'. Both functions list the available 'Frontend modules' to which the user has access.
Basically, setting this option just marks the page so the backend knows this page contains eg. a forum or is the root page of a shopping section on the website. And based on this knowledge the backend is able to display a shortcut list as well as relevant functionality in the 'Web&gt;Modules' module. The frontend display is - largely - not affected.
So in effect, by 'marking' a page to be a 'Shop' module simply means it'll show up in the shortcut list of modules in the backend.

There may be a little more to it than this, but for details on the subject, you must refer to the administration documentation.

It's recommended that only admin-users are allowed access to this field!</source>

If and how these files are used depends on your template. So basically which files you attach here and in which order they must be listed is determined by your specific website template and thus you should seek instructions in the documentation for your specific website.
As an example this field could be used from the template to allow you to attach a logo-image to the page. Or the template might be programmed to expect the first file to be an image used as a link in the navigation menu.

Note that also search engine extensions for TYPO3 (e.g. Indexed search) can be configured to make use of the keywords.

In TYPO3, the keywords can also be used to create a menu of related pages. Create a content element of type 'Sitemap' and then choose the menu type &lt;i&gt;Related pages (based on keywords)&lt;/i&gt;.</source>

Other than the description, the abstract is not meant for display in search engine result lists, but for use in your own project exclusively.

By default, TYPO3 lets you create a content element of type &lt;i&gt;Sitemap&lt;/i&gt; and then choose &lt;i&gt;Menu of subpages to these pages (with abstract)&lt;/i&gt; to create an overview of articles. If an abstract is available it will be used instead of the description.

				<source>&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
Normally the 'Web&gt;Page' module lets you create content in four columns, Left, Normal, Right, Border. However most websites use only a single or two columns. So some of these content columns are just taking up space and may even be confusing to users.
If you enter this string in the 'TSconfig' field, the 'Web&gt;Page' module will allow you to work only in the 'Normal' and 'Border' column!

&lt;em&gt;mod.web_layout.tt_content.colPos_list = 0,3&lt;/em&gt;

				<source>&lt;b&gt;Hide default translation of page&lt;/b&gt;
If set the page is only available in one of the translations. So any attempt to access the page in the default language will show an error message.

&lt;b&gt;Hide page if no translation for current language exists&lt;/b&gt;
If set the page access will be blocked with an error message if there is no translation in the current language. By default access to a non-translated page will just show the default language content.</source>
