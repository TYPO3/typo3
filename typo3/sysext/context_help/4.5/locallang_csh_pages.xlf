'Backend User Section' is an option which creates pages that are only visible in the Frontend for Backend users who are logged in.

&lt;b&gt;Link&lt;/b&gt;
'Shortcut' pages jump to another page in the Pagetree.
'Mount Point' pages bring content from another branch of the Pagetree into the current branch.
'Link to External URL' is similar to 'Shortcut' but points to external URLs instead of TYPO3 pages.

&lt;b&gt;Special&lt;/b&gt;
'Folder' is a page type which is not shown as a webpage but is instead stores records of your choice.
'Recycler' is a garbage can. Pages and records in the Recycler are not visible in the Frontend.
'Menu Separator' is only useful if your Frontend memus are programmed to use it. It does not represent a page with content but is intended to be an unclickable placeholder in the menu.

&lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt; Each Page Type is represented by a unique icon. The available page types can be restricted for users so all of the options described above may not be visible. Finally, particuilar record typoes may only be allowed on certain page types, but any record can be placed in a 'Folder.'</source>

URL Aliases are normally assigned to only the most frequently used pages rather than all pages. In most TYPO3 configurations you would be able to use the syntax '.. &amp;lt;link one_two_three&amp;gt;go to the page&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt; ..' to create a link to the page. This is easier to remember.
Another use is if you need to change which page a commonly used link points to. In this case you can delete the URL Alias for the original page and re-add it on the new page. All links using the URL Alias would now refer to the new page and its ID number.</source>

To optimize your page for search engines like Google you should not use more than 3 to 6 keywords. You should also make sure that the keywords are found in the content of the page.

Note that search engine extensions for TYPO3 such as Indexed Search can also be configured to make use of the keywords.

The keywords can also be used to create a menu of related pages. Create a Content Element of type 'Sitemap' and then choose the menu type &lt;i&gt;Related pages (based on keywords)&lt;/i&gt;.</source>
