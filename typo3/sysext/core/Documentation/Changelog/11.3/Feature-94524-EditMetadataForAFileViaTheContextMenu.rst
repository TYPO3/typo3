Feature: #94524 - Edit metadata for a file via the context menu
===============================================================

See :issue:`94524`

Description
===========

Editing metadata of files is an important task for editors.
To ease the use, the context menu for files has been extended
by a new option :guilabel:`Edit metadata of this file`, which can be
used to direly jump into the corresponding editing mask.

Impact
======

It is now possible to edit a file's metadata directly via the
context menu.
