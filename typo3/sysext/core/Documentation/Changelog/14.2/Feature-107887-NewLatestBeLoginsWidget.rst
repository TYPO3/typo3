=====================================================

See :issue:`107887`

Description
===========

A new dashboard widget :guilabel:`Latest backend logins` has been introduced
to display the most recent backend user logins directly in the TYPO3 Dashboard.
This allows administrators to quickly monitor user activity and track recent
backend access patterns without navigating through the system log.

The widget provides a configurable interface where administrators can set the
number of logins to display, offering flexibility in monitoring scope.

Each login entry shows:

* The corresponding login time

Key benefits:

* Displays recent backend user logins with user details and timestamps
* Provides direct access to login monitoring without navigating system logs
* Offers configurable display limits for different monitoring needs
* Enhances security monitoring with quick access to login patterns

Impact
======

This feature improves administrative oversight by providing immediate visibility
into recent backend user activity directly within the dashboard interface.
