=====================================================
Feature: #94544 - Add new SMTP configuration settings
=====================================================

See :issue:`94544`

Description
===========

A few more SMTP options are now supported by TYPO3 and can be set in the Install Tool:

- transport_smtp_restart_threshold
Sets the maximum number of messages to send before re-starting the transport.

- transport_smtp_restart_threshold_sleep
The number of seconds to sleep between stopping and re-starting the transport

- transport_smtp_ping_threshold
Sets the minimum number of seconds required between two messages, before the server is pinged. If
the transport wants to send a message and the time since the last message exceeds the specified
threshold, the transport will ping the server first (NOOP command) to check if the connection is
still alive. Otherwise the message will be sent without pinging the server first.

Do not set the threshold too low, as the SMTP server may drop the connection if there are too many
non-mail commands (like pinging the server with NOOP).

It is now also possible to define an array with SMTP stream options in the AdditionalConfiguration.php.

Configuration Example:

.. code-block:: php

    return [
        //....
        'MAIL' => [
            'transport' => 'smtp',
            'transport_sendmail_command' => ' -t -i ',
            'transport_smtp_server' => 'localhost:1025',
            'transport_smtp_stream_options' => [
                'ssl' => [
                    'verify_peer' => false,
                    'verify_peer_name' => false,
                ]
            ],
        ],
        //....
    ];


Impact
======

Now it is possible to set more options for some smtp cases.
