Description
===========

The class :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Service\MagicImageService`, which was

public methods will raise a deprecation level log message.


Affected installations
======================

TYPO3 installations with custom extensions using the class or its public
methods. The extension scanner will report usages as strong match.

Migration
=========

functionality, just copy the corresponding code into your custom extension.
