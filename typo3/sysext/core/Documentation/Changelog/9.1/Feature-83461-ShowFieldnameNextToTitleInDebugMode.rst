Feature: #83461 - Show fieldname next to title in debug mode
============================================================

See :issue:`83461`


Description
===========

If the configuration `['BE']['debug']` is enabled and the current user is an administrator, the name of a DB field
is prepended to the title of each field generated by the `FormEngine`.


Impact
======

The correct name of a field is important to know for developers and integrators. Examples are setting up access
permissions or configuration using TsConfig.

Instead of looking into the source code of the browser, it is now possible to display those name by enabling the debug
mode for the backend.
