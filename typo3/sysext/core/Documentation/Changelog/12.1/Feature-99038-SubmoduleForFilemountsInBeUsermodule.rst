=========================================
Feature: #99038 - Overview for file mounts
=========================================

See :issue:`99038`

Description
===========

A new submodule was added to the :guilabel:`Backend Users` module. It provides an
overview over all available file mounts with detailed data. Additionally an info
window displays also the references to the file mount.


Impact
======

It is now possible to get an overview about available file mounts
without switching to the :guilabel:`List` module on pid=0.
