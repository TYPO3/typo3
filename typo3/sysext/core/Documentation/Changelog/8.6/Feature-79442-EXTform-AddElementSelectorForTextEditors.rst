Feature: #79442 - EXT:form - add element selector for text editors
==================================================================

See :issue:`79442`

Description
===========

A new button has been added to the text editors of the form editor. Clicking on this button opens an overlay with
available form elements of the current form. The user has the possibility to choose one of these form elements.
The process adds the dynamic identifier (e.g. "{text-1}") to the current text editor field.
