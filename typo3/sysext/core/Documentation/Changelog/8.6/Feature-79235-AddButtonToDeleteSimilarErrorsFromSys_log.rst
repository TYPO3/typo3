Feature: #79235 - Add button to delete similar errors from sys_log
==================================================================

See :issue:`79235`

Description
===========

The log module of TYPO3 now shows a button to delete multiple errors at once based on
the `details` field of the `sys_log` table.
This comes in handy when you fixed an error that spammed the log before.
