Feature: #79420 - Hide files from list of documentation
=======================================================

See :issue:`79420`

Description
===========

The list of displayed documentation files gets pretty long over time. The user might want to hide those already
tackled or of no interest from listing. This is possible via checkboxes.

A new section has been introduced that lists those hidden files to bring them back if necessary.


Impact
======

The list of documentation files can be shortened now.
