Deprecation: #94979 - Using CacheManager or Database Connections during TYPO3 bootstrap
=======================================================================================

See :issue:`94979`

Description
===========

TYPO3 now triggers a PHP :php:`E_USER_DEPRECATED` error if extension authors
or site admins have code in their :file:`ext_localconf.php`,
:file:`Configuration/TCA/*` configuration files or :file:`ext_tables.php`, that
calls the :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Cache\CacheManager` or interacts with the database.

This is important for extension authors as TYPO3 will become
stricter in the future in terms of booting up TYPO3's Core Configuration, making
typical requests much faster, as all configuration can be cached away. When
using TYPO3 in a build environment, this will also lead to possibilities to
pre-warmup caches during the build phase of a new deployment.


Impact
======

Accessing the database and utilizing the Cache Manager in
these files will trigger a PHP :php:`E_USER_DEPRECATED` error.


Affected Installations
======================

TYPO3 installations with extensions using Cache Manager
or Database Connections in their configuration files (see above).


Migration
=========

Use proper places to initialize extensions, and only when
needed to reduce the general time to boot up TYPO3's configuration.
