=======================================================
Deprecation: #95083 - Backend toolbar CacheActions hook
=======================================================

See :issue:`95083`

Description
===========

The TYPO3 hook :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['additionalBackendItems']['cacheActions']`
which can be used to modify the cache actions, shown in the TYPO3 Backend
top toolbar, has been marked as deprecated.

The accompanied PHP interface for the hook
:php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Toolbar\ClearCacheActionsHookInterface` has been
marked as deprecated as well.

Impact
======

If the hook is registered in a TYPO3 installation, a PHP :php:`E_USER_DEPRECATED` error is triggered.
The extension scanner also detects any usage
of the deprecated interface as strong, and the definition of the
hook as weak match.

Affected Installations
======================

TYPO3 installations with custom extensions using this hook.

Migration
=========

Migrate to the newly introduced :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Backend\Event\ModifyClearCacheActionsEvent` PSR-14 event.
