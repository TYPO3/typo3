Feature: #50501 - Extension Manager: Disable automatic installation
===================================================================

See :issue:`50501`

Description
===========

The extension manager currently downloads and installs an extension from TER directly. Some people want to do
audits or modifications before installing an extension, therefore there is now an option to disable the automatic
installation process and just download an extension.

The option is located in the settings of the extension manager itself (Extensions > Installed > Extension Manager).
