========================================================
Feature: #78488 - Add rel="noreferrer" to external links
========================================================

See :issue:`78488`

Description
===========

All links processed by :typoscript:`typolink` with external links opening in a new window have been extended to contain
:html:`rel="noreferrer"`.

Links opening in a new window are defined as those having an attribute :html:`target` which is either not empty,
:html:`_self`, :html:`_top` or :html:`_parent`.

..  note::
    Initially this feature added :html:`rel="noopener noreferrer`. However :html:`noreferrer` also implies the property 
    :html:`noopener`. Therfore the later war removed.


Impact
======

This property improves the security of the site:

:html:`noreferrer`
   This property prevents the browser, when navigating to another page, to send the page address, or any other value,
   as referrer in according HTTP header. :html:`noreferrer` also implies the property :html:`noopener`, which instructs
   the browser to open the link without granting the new browsing context access to the document that opened it.
