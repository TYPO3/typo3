Feature: #83748 - Show value of fields in debug mode
====================================================

See :issue:`83748`

Description
===========

If the configuration :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['debug']` is enabled and the current user is an
administrator, the value of select, radio and checkbox fields which are generated by the :php:`FormEngine` is appended
to its label.


Impact
======

The correct name of a field is important to know for developers and integrators. Examples are setting up access
permissions or configuration using TsConfig.

Instead of looking into the source code of the browser, it is now possible to display those name by enabling the debug
mode for the backend.
