Breaking: #75834 - Reorder processing of TCA Select items
=========================================================

See :issue:`75834`


Description
===========

It's now possible again to add and remove items via `pageTSconfig` after `itemsProcFunc` has been processed
for TCA select fields.


Impact
======

Items generated by `itemsProcFunc` no longer have the highest priority.


Affected Installations
======================

Any installation that relied on `itemsProcFunc` being the source of truth for a given field.


Migration
=========

Cross check if you added or removed items via `pageTSconfig`. These might be really gone now.
