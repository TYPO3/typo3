Feature: #92022 - Show week numbers in DateTimePicker for editors
==================================================================

See :issue:`92022`

Description
===========

In addition to the days of the week, the DateTimePicker now also shows the calendar weeks.
This is helpful for editors to find the desired date more quickly using a calendar week.

The DateTimePicker is used in the TCA forms, for example, to define the start and end date for content or pages.
