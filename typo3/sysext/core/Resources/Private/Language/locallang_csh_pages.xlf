				<source>'Standard' is the most common Page Type and is used for normal webpages.
'Backend User Section' is an option which creates pages that are only visible in the Frontend for Backend users who are logged in.

&lt;b&gt;Link&lt;/b&gt;
'Shortcut' pages jump to another page in the Pagetree.
'Mount Point' pages bring content from another branch of the Pagetree into the current branch.
'Link to External URL' is similar to 'Shortcut' but points to external URLs instead of TYPO3 pages.

&lt;b&gt;Special&lt;/b&gt;
'Folder' is a page type which is not shown as a webpage but is instead stores records of your choice.
'Recycler' is a garbage can. Pages and records in the Recycler are not visible in the Frontend.
'Menu Separator' is only useful if your Frontend memus are programmed to use it. It does not represent a page with content but is intended to be an unclickable placeholder in the menu.

&lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt; Each Page Type is represented by a unique icon. The available page types can be restricted for users so all of the options described above may not be visible. Finally, particuilar record typoes may only be allowed on certain page types, but any record can be placed in a 'Folder.'</source>

				<source>A URL Alias is a unique identification string for a page. You can use this string instead of the ID number to refer to the page.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="alias.details" resname="alias.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>Ultimately a page is identified by its ID number. For example, you may access a page in TYPO3 at '.../?id=123'. If the page with ID '123' has the URL Alias 'one_two_three', then the URL '.../?id=one_two_three' would display exactly the same page, because 'one_two_three' is a URL Alias for the ID '123'.
URL Aliases are normally assigned to only the most frequently used pages rather than all pages. In most TYPO3 configurations you would be able to use the syntax '.. &amp;lt;link one_two_three&amp;gt;go to the page&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt; ..' to create a link to the page. This is easier to remember.
Another use is if you need to change which page a commonly used link points to. In this case you can delete the URL Alias for the original page and re-add it on the new page. All links using the URL Alias would now refer to the new page and its ID number.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="alias.syntax" resname="alias.syntax" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>A URL Alias can contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters and must be unique.
Please note: If the URL Alias already exists in the site, it will have a number added to the end of it.</source>

				<source>The Link Target overrides the default Link Target behavior, which should already be configured correctly for most pages in the website TypoScript template.
There are additional options available by using the Link Target field

Setting an integer value at the beginning of the field sets it as the default type for the page.
For example, if an RSS feed is configured in TypoScript as typeNum=100, setting the Link Target to 100 could be used to add an RSS link in the menu.

The following syntax is used to open the page in a popup window:
400x200 - Opens the page in a 400x200 popup window.
230x450:resizable=0,location=1 - Opens the page in a 230x450 popup window that is not resizable and has an address bar.

Combined:
100 600x350 - Opens the page in a 600x350 popup with type=100
2 _blank - Opens the page with target "_blank" and type=2</source>

In addition, the description will be displayed if you create a Content Element of type 'Sitemap' and then choose the menu type &lt;i&gt;Menu of subpages to these pages (with abstract)&lt;/i&gt;. If an abstract exists for the page, it will be used instead of the description.
