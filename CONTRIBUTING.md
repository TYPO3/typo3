Contributing
------------

TYPO3 CMS core is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to join the project by submitting changes.

Have a look at our [detailed contribution walkthrough][1].

If you like to contribute code, please use the [main git repository][2], all changes are
 processed in our [review system][3]. The [GitHub repository][4] is a synchronized
 mirror of the primary git repository and pull requests via GitHub are not supported at the moment.

If you like to contribute to our [documentation][5], use the "Edit me on GitHub" button
 in the top right of each manual or reference or just make a pull request in any of the repositories
 that can be found in the TYPO3 [documentation team GitHub organisation][6].
