	* Fixed bug #23: cgi-fcgi issues

2004-04-30  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Changed warning message for typo3/ext in the install tool for the directories. Now directories have the following requirements, where the values mean. See Changelog of t3lib_install.php for more details.

2004-04-29  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Resolved bug #0000031:
	* Moved table definition for cache_imagesizes from sysext/cms/ext_tables.sql to stddb/tables.sql
	* Removed Clear All Cache for cache_imagesizes in t3lib_tcemain::clear_cacheCmd
	* Added new section "Clean up database" in the install tool. This is used for clearing the cached image sizes

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added possibility to prefix references to wizard scripts with "EXT:" for reference to wizard scripts in extension.

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added prefix to relative file reference in @import style sheet 

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed bug where DB mounts for a user which has been deleted would still show up in the page tree.

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed bug with pageNotFound handling.

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added a PAGE Tsconfig option to disable the automatic clearing of page cache when records are edited.

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Updated "cms" extension with most recent labels from TYPO3.org

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Updated "lang" extension with most recent labels from TYPO3.org

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added Latvian, Japanese and Vietnamese languages

2004-04-24  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added to TypoScript object browser that the title text of the object links contains information about in which lines in the TypoScript body code that a certain object path is set, cleared, copied.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "removeBadHTML" option to stdWrap - this can help to avoid XSS dangerous HTML.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added feature in TYpoScript data type "getText" to get values from GET arrays via "GPvar" key word. Now you can specify ".date = GPvar : tx_myext|mode|index" to get value of &tx_myext[mode][index]

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added option "$TYPO3_CONF_VARS["GFX"]["gdlib_2"] = 'no_imagecopyresized_fix';" to avoid using the imagecopyresized workaround in stdgraphic class which has failed for some. Whether the workaround is needed anymore is not certain. Some people say it works fine without.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added TypoScript condition "hostname" for matching hostnames for IP addresses.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added API for configuring extra tables/fields for listing in Web > Page

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added option "mod.web_list.clickTitleMode = edit/info/show" to determine alternative behaviours of title links in the Web > List module.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added Page TSconfig option "mod.web_list.listOnlyInSingleTableView = 1" which makes the List module list only the table names by default. You have to click the table name to get the single-table view before records show up. This is useful for pages containing many records from many tables.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added refresh button to taskcenter (not in core CVS)

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "Login failure" message in backend login box

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added to user authentication that the HTTP_USER_AGENT is hashed and a part of the session lookup (in other words, if the HTTP_USER_AGENT stays constant the session stays as well). Also added possibility of configuring that the IP adresse used to lock down sessions is only part 1,2,3 or 4 (all) used. Mainly this is easily configurable for frontend users (which has had the "security level" set to "2" now instead of disabled totally!). For backend users I didn't make configuration options in TYPO3_CONF_VARS - just wanted to know if people needed it there first (not to bloat options....)

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added possibility of jumping directly to editing a page in the backend. You specify "alt_main.php?edit=[page id]" and you will be brought directly to the page edit module.

2004-04-22  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added in RTE link box: Searched *into* Content ELements of type Text and Text w/Image after anchors (<a name="...">) and lists them as well with content elements to which an anchor link can be made.

2004-04-22  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added configuration options for what level of pages cache is cleared when you edit a page header. You can not get children and grand-parents cleared as well. (TCEMAIN.clear..... in Page TSconfig)

2004-04-21  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "altText" and "titleText" attributes to the IMGMAP object (used for IMGMENU: Now you can add values to the alt and title attributes of image maps).
	* Added "ATagTitle" attribute for TMENU / GMENU so the menu links can have a title attribute for accessible websites.
	* Added "allStdWrap" attributes for TMENUITEM/GMENU item states. + some other properties requested.

2004-04-21  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added features around "includeCSS" TypoScript property for PAGE objects: "import" and "alternate" attributes (booleans) are now supported.

2004-04-20  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Changed a bunch of things, added a few new features to make TYPO3 accessible. One significant thing was the attributes "altText", "titleText" and "longdescURL" for IMAGE, IMGTEXT, FILE and ->filelink() in TypoScript.

2004-04-20  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Completed changes for XHTML compliance requests from the Accessibility group. Mainly adding support for more XHTML types, adding attributes like xml:lang to <html> tag, support for "dir" attributes in HTML tags, support for writing inline styles and JavaScript to a temporary file to keep a clean HTML <head> section...

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* "minItems", "maxItems" and "begin" has been added as properties to MENU objects (like TMENU, GMENU, IMGMENU etc) so you can set these values for the individual menus (as they probably should have been in the first place...).

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added a checkbox to the page header in the "cms" extension called "Hide in menu". With this checkbox the page is excluded from menus on the totally same terms as doktype=5 ("Not in menu") does. The implementation is believed to be complete (although there might be some places overlooked). The checkbox renders the doktype 5 "Not in menu" obsolete; the idea is that the checkbox should be used in the future. Finally - if anyone read this far - I prophecise, that within two weeks from this moment someone will approach me and want to have a visual response to the "Hide in menu" checkbox in the icon; currently the page icon does NOT change it looks (and it would be very doubtful if we could justify making it change...).

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added new FORM cObject type, "label", which inserts a label instead of a field. Also fixed ordering problem when the "dataArray" attribute of FORM is used (now renders the form in the numerical order of the elements instead of order of appearance).

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed incompatibility between Mount Points and property "overrideId" in menus.

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added support for JavaScript regular expression evaluation in FORM cObject. Means that fields in formmails can now be checked for a pattern and not only for "required".

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added possibility to copy database/file elements attached to records; You can now click the icon of these elements in the editing forms and get a (limited) context menu for these elements.
	* Fixed some other bugs around.

2004-04-16  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* fixed detection of schemes (http://, ftp:// etc) in "typolinks". Now email addresses are detected only if NOT prepended with a scheme. Also the presence of a scheme will make typolink function detect the input as a plain URL which should just be passed through untouched.

2004-04-14  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Mount Points (Mount pages) reworking:
Changelog:
Fixed bugs in Mount Points / Status:
- Added protection against forging the MP variable value; The exact number of MP var parts must exist, mountpoints cannot exist in rootline (must be resolved) etc.
- Fixed false detection of CUR, ACT etc. states in HMENU (including x_LAYERS menus)
- Added support for typolink linking to closest page in rootline (thus detecting Mounts)
- Fixed support for correct MP-vars for any entryLevel number for HMENU
- Added option to overlay the mount point with the mounted page; This means the mount point gets substituted with the mounted page and not only the subpages of the mounted page. This is called "Overlay" mode. Can be set on a per-mount level (checkbox in the pages record). Only doktypes < 200 can be mounted in overlay mode.
- Checked consistency of exclude pages/hidden/starttime/endtime and found it to be ok.
- HMENU special types supported:
	rootline : full support
	list,directory : Supported, but only if the ID values supplied are in the main rootline of the site. The pages in the menus are allowed to be mount points of course. If the supplied IDs are outside the rootline they will loose their connection to the rootline unless "config.MP_mapRootPoints" is configured to supply some mapping.
	browse : Not supported: Didn't have time to do it, but should be possible to implement technically.
	keyword/updated : Supported.
- Support for chained mount points; A mount point can mount another mount point. "Substitute Mount Point (this page) with Mounted page:" (overlay mode) is evaluated based on the LAST mountpoint in chain. In overlay mode enableFields are evaluated for the Mounted page while in normal mode it is evaluated for the mount point.
- Fixed problem with caching of the same page id with various MP vars; The page in the "cache_pageSection" table had to be identified by a combination of page id and MPvar.
- No support for Page "shortcut" mode: You cannot successfully make a shortcut to a mounted page. Support is currently not planned.
- Support added for search in mount pages; basically this is done since tslib_cObj::getTreeList() is now including MountPages as well! Since getTreeList() does not return any information about MPvars for an ID (its only a list of ids!) then you should enable "config.MP_mapRootPoints = root" or so - otherwise the mounted page ids will not obtain the necessary "MP" var.
- links to mount points re-maps themselves to right title/uid


2004-04-05  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Modified typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/class.tslib_content.php:
		* fixed bug: When providing an imgList for the IMGTEXT TLO, no spaces were accepted in the comma separated list. Now using t3lib_div::trimExplode for splitting.
		* fixed bug: The alt and title parameters have not been set correctly when using IMGTEXT with the imgList property. Now everything works as expected: You may specify alt/title texts for the whole IMGTEXT, or for each imgObj independently

	* Added support for automatically caching image dimensions instead of executing IM identify.  Original extension provided by Michael Stucki.
		* Affected files: t3lib/class.t3lib_stdgraphic.php, typo3/sysext/cms/ext_tables.sql
		* Tested by Ingmar, Michael and Robert

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed problem with domain look-up when an extra "/" was added to eg. "typo3.com//" -> showing "typo3.org" instead

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed some browser detection bugs in t3lib_matchcondition and t3lib_div. Not necessarily exhaustive! For instance a report on Netscape 7.2 being wrongly detected may not be resolved (need teh value of HTTP_USER_AGENT to solve it since I do not have netscape 7.2!)

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added full safety for the internal TYPO3 formmail; email addresses in the fields "recipient" and "recipient_copy" are encrypted in the transfer and the "formmail" interface is safe for spam-misuse (since a proper recipient address cannot be forged automatically).
!!!If someone are using the "formmail" API from other renderers than the FORM cObject in TypoScript you will have to set the recipient address to the encrypted value by default OR alternatively disabled the check by TYPO3_CONF_VARS[FE][strictFormmail] = FALSE

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added Jens Ellerbrocks suggestion for "postUserFuncInt" in stdWrap.

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added some file icons from Ben and Emile

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "General Plugin" to content elmeent wizard list.

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed SSL problem and many other minor things

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed spam-protection of email adresses inserted by "mailto:..." in text.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed another small bug in detection of simulateStaticDocuments.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed distinction between ' and " in EM.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Removed "onblur" handler in "browser.php" - had no great significance apparently and bugged people on Mac.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* In t3lib_div::linkThisUrl(), remove "?" if no parameters were found.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "config.doctype = none" support - omits any doctype in the frontend.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed an error for form wizard (and others...) where the return URL would be wrong if the wizard was activated right after having saved a new record (would like back to a new record again).
	* Further, I added the option of xmlOutput from the table and form wizards. This option is configured in the wizard setup. There is NO frontend rendering supporting the XML format yet. But it might be very handy (and recommended) for other applications wanting to use the table and formwizards.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Changed the way simulateStaticDocuments are resolved

2004-03-28  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Changed "t3lib_div::calluserFunc" and t3lib_div::getUserObj to use "&" as token for persistent (global) objects rather than ">" - PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CODE if you happend to use these features already (less than a week old).

2004-03-24  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added <span title=""> to path in backend modules in Web main module; you can now see the full path (non-truncated) as title text.

2004-03-24  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added RTE API and changed the "rte" extension to use that.
	* Added t3lib_div::getUserObj() which returns an OBJECT , instead of executing a method call like callUserFunc() does.

2004-03-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed problem in Extension Manager where files and directories was not written with correct permissions. I also added t3lib_div::mkdir() general function for creating directories.

2004-03-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed bug that page tree didn't unfold when entering page id in the shortcut frame.

2004-03-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added a checkbox for be-users to disable IP locking. This is useful if you have backend users complaining about being thrown off sessions.

[RC2 note:
As usual the changelog is not at all "complete" in terms of what has been changed. I regret this, but the tradeoff would be slower development if all details had to go in here which is why they don't.
However all IMPORTANT changes that might break compatibility somewhere is always entered in the log with "!!!" prefixed.
- kasper
]

- Modified how external URLs for pages are redirected to: In case the URL seems to be *relative* ("blabla/index.php", "?id=12..") the URL is prefixed with the site URL. Otherwise it won't work with "realurl" extension.
- Added features in t3lib_div::callUserFunction(); You can not specify objects to be instantiated once and stored globally for reuse (simply change "->" to "->>") and you can additionally specify a class file to include as a prefix to the method/function reference.
- Added a new constant "TYPO3_DLOG" which is tied to TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][enable_DLOG] and t3lib_div::devLog function; the framework provides possibility of implementing logging calls all over the source code, both frontend and backend with a minimum loss of speed if no logging is asked for and with the possibility of better debugging/tracking for developers
- Added some new options to array2xml to obtain XML creation from arrays which observes PHP data types and has options for better protection of tag names etc. Fixed a bug in the detection of binary data in arrays for base64 encoding as well.
- Script "tslib/media/scripts/makeMenu_keywords_updated.inc has been removed since it was obsolete.
- Fixed problem with references in FlexForms! Now all references gets correct when copying a page and images will also be copied.

Generally:
- Database Wrapper class "t3lib_DB" has been created, containing simple wrapper functions for MySQL and query building functions.

!!! - tslib_content::getUpdateJS()		Is NEVER stripping off slashes now, please update your code in extensions if you rely on this (most unlikely)
!!! - tslib_content::DBgetInsert() + tslib_content::DBgetUpdate() 	Will ALWAYS apply slashes to values in queries now (for security). If you use these functions in your extensions, please update your code to the new situation! (These two functions now use their counterparts in t3lib_DB class)
!!! - IP locking has been added to user sessions: For backend this is DEFAULT (which means that users might experience to be logged out if their IP changes dynamically during a session!) and for frontend users it is disabled by default (but can be enabled from TYPO3_CONF_VARS)
!!! - t3lib_BEfunc::DBcompileInsert() and t3lib_BEfunc::DBcompileUpdate() has been modified so they ALWAYS add slashes to values inserted in queries. (Further they are depreciated now since they just call their counterparts in t3lib_DB class.)
- Implemented t3lib_DB class as a first step towards database abstraction. For now it contains wrapper functions that ALL code should use in the future.
!!! - tslib_cObj::DBcompileInsert has been removed since it was obsolete.

25/2:
!!!- Removed global extension "Extrep"

2004-03-19  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

- Fixed SQL statement (missing quotes) in t3lib_dmailer, reported by Martin Erichsen.
  See: http://typo3.org/1422+M55c87d9b3b8.0.html'

2004-02-12  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	*
Made changes to class.tslib_content.php:
- added function getAltParam () which acts as an abstraction method / API creating alt and title parameters for img tags
- added a new TypoScript configuration property: "titleText" (string / stdWrp) similar to "altText". If only altText is specified, it will also be used for the "title" parameter
- used getAltParam in IMGTEXT () for rendering the alt tag
- used getAltParam in cImage () for rendering the alt tag
- added title="" when neccessary, ie. all cleargifs havin an alt="" parameter now also have a title=""


Kasper Skårhøj, 6/2:
 - Added processing option to RTE, "proc.plainImageMode"
 - Added options for select and group types in TCA to set the selector box style.
 - Added $altPageId parameter to function linkTP*() in tslib_pibase + pi_list_linkSingle()
 - Changed the order of <?xml> and <!DOCTYPE> in the frontend for XHTML around again. And added an option, "doctypeSwitch" which will reverse the order for those needing that. And finally the "doctype" option fed with a value that is not "xhtml_frames", "xhtml_trans" or "xhtml_strict" will be outputted AS the doctype!
 - Implemented checkbox for show thumbnails in Element browser/file and RTE select image dialog.
 - Implemented pop-up window size selector in link wizard


Kasper Skårhøj
	* Removed "mininews" from global extensions - that was an error in RC1
	* Removed global extensions "beuser_tracking/ classic_welcome/ design_components/ tt_links/" from main distribtion. They are either obsolete or irrelevant and it has been considered responsible to remove them like this.

2003-12-23  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Added another TSconfig option for replacing the create new content wizard (-> templavoila). Only added a few lines.

20/12: Change the backend icon processing: Not, by default icons are NOT processed with overlay of hidden, start/endtime icons; The icons are found preprocessed with the source icon. This can be disabled so the old behaviour will apply, see TYPO3_CONF_VARS[GFX] - however group-numbers on icons have been permanently disabled.

Fixed all:
- Click menu does not work in task-center/weblist
- admin-only flag in TYPO3_CONF_VARS so only administrators can log in/be authenticated.
- Click menu does not work in Opera.
- BUG: Row-highlighting for both Page and Folder trees are not stable enough.
- BUG: when editing records from Web>View the palette will not show properly in the topframe!
- BUG: Email forms wizard: "Checked: " for checkboxes does not work!
- BUG: File>List , list-frame: Click menu does NOT work in Mozilla! cannot find the bug!
- Convert selecting of filemounts from GROUP selector to a selectorbox.
- Option: Frameset modules without the "border" frame and therefore adjustable freely.
Changed all usage of t3lib_div::GPvar('SET') to t3lib_div::GPvar('SET',1) (stripping slashes) where its used to set MOD_SETTINGS for backend modules.

2003-12-16  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Added and changed some features related to the replacement of default page module by a custom one (templavoila). See t3lib_positionmap, t3lib_tsfebeuserauth, alt_shortcut, alt_clickmenu

2003-12-16  Kasper Skårhøj

	* Added new languages labels for cms and lang extensions // increased version number to 3.6.0RC1

2003-12-16  Kasper Skårhøj
	* Changed order of DOCTYPE and XML declaration for XHTML support (for standards compliance mode detection in MSIE)
2003-10-24  Kasper Skårhøj
	* Moved changelog.txt to ChangeLog ("cvs compliant")
TYPO3 3.6.0-dev
PHP:
!!! $LANG->php3Lang + ->mainLang has been cancelled and replaced with a local-lang call: Search/replace regex: search for '->php3Lang\["([^]]*)"\]\["([^]]*)"\]', replace with '->sL("LLL:EXT:lang/locallang_core.php:\1.\2")'. Same for ->mainLang.
!!! The global var $AB has been removed (since the "alternative backend" is now THE backend and the classic is totally gone. If you use this var, you can safely expect $AB's value to be TRUE and therefore remove all code which would excute if it was FALSE.
!!! Removed what looked like unused functions and variables in the backend frameset JavaScript.
!!! Change db_list_frame and file_list_frame to just "list_frame".
!!! Cleaned up a lot in the template-class.
!!! dfw() and rfw() functions must be substituted with $GLOBALS["TBE_TEMPLATE"]->dfw() / ->rfw()
!!! fw() is highly depreciated (and does NOT wrap strings anymore!)
!!! if (top.theMenu) top.theMenu.recentuid
!!! Constant "PATH_temp" has been cancelled - no scripts seemed to use it and the dir is depreciated.
!!! typo3/temp/ has been cancelled. Changed to typo3/icons/ for STATIC icons and PATH_site.typo3temp/ is now used for the locally generated icons. So no more typo3/temp/ to be writable.
!!! t3lib_BEfunc::loadTablesDescriptions() and t3lib_BEfunc::loadSingleTableDescription is removed. A function call like t3lib_BEfunc::loadSingleTableDescription("pages",$LANG->lang); is substituted with $LANG->loadSingleTableDescription("pages");
!!! Function t3lib_BEfunc::pTypes() remove - nothing used it (apparently. prove me wrong... :-)
!!! Function t3lib_div::extParseurl removed
!!! Function t3lib_div::imagefinder, t3lib_div::linkfinder, t3lib_div::getStrippedURL, t3lib_div::getMimeType, t3lib_div::debug_white_space, t3lib_div::debug_code, t3lib_div::parsetime, t3lib_div::hardspace, t3lib_div::break_text, t3lib_div::unbreak_text removed
!!! The font files "arial.ttf" and "verdana.ttf" has been removed from the folder t3lib/fonts/ and substituted with similar typefaces, "nimbus.ttf" and "vera.ttf" respectively.
!!! The script "t3lib/formmail.php" has been removed. Was not used and didn't work anyways.
!!! The classes t3lib_pagetree and t3lib_browsetree has been divided into four new classes (folder,page,browse + treeview) - and as a rule of thumb, the API has been modified so much that you should rather check all you applications using these classes in DETAIL! Consider it a reimplementation.
!!! The three rte_*.php scripts in TYPO3 core has been moved TO the "rte" extension! This also means that any extension classes must have updated their XCLASS registration keys to the new file positions.
!!! status_file.php is gone...
!!! The typo3/ scripts db_new_content_el.php and db_layout.php has been moved into the sysext/cms/layout/ folder. Further, the classes have been remodelled a lot. If you link to these scripts or extend their classes in your applications, you should observe the compatibility!
Charsets:
- A new class "t3lib_cs" has been added. It contains homemade functions for conversion to and from a list of charsets (conversion tables found in t3lib/csconvtbl/). The conversion could be speeded up enourmously by using PHP functions but I simply didn't find any that could be used. By time we can substitute the PHP-processing with internal PHP functions if possible.
- In TYPO3_CONF_VARS we can now set up a system charset. [BE][forceCharset] This is used a) for storage of information and b) for whole backend. Default is that charset of the current user (as always), but clearly recommended is "UTF-8"!!!
	- The recommendation is that the forceCharset configuration is used for multilingual sites. In this way the SAME charset is ALWAYS used in the backend regardless of which language the current backend user has chosen. Thus all content in the sysmte is stored in the same charset.
