	* Release of TYPO3 3.7.1

2005-05-21  Michael Stucki  <michael@typo3.org>

	* Added TYPO3_branch constant in t3lib/config_default.php
	* Backported secureFormmail patch which adds a new option TYPO3_CONF_VARS[FE][secureFormmail] which is enabled by default. For details, see http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-20050307-1/
	* A new button to automatically create a random encryptionKey has been added to class.tx_install.php. Thanks to Karsten Dambekalns.
	* Backported bugfix #0000464: TYPO3 does not send mails when using Postfix versions < 2.0. The problem is that for setting the return-path correctly, the -f flag is used when PHP is calling sendmail. This is not supported in the sendmail wrapper for Postfix. See the function sendTheMail in class.t3lib_htmlmail.php for further information. Thanks to Jan-Erik Revsbech.
	* Added a new option TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][enableReturnPath] which is disabled by default. Until this is enabled, the ReturnPath is not sent by t3lib_htmlmail. Thanks to Jan-Erik Revsbech.
	* Changed some small MySQL related things in class.tx_install.php

2005-05-19  Peter Niederlag  <pn@kreativwert.de>

	* Backported bugfix #0000849: TSConfig forceDisplayFieldIcons will work regardless of settings for adminPanel
	* Backported bugfix for db_new_content_el.php: Consider allow/deny for CE's
	* Backported bugfix #0000416 in class.t3lib_install.php: Problems with auto_increment and default values
	* Backported bugfix #0000422 in class.t3lib_stdgraphic.php: potential problems with Charset Conversion
	* Backported bugfix #0000958: require_once() instead of require()

2004-11-15  Michael Stucki  <michael@typo3.org>

	* Changed <meta name="generator" content="TYPO3 3.6 CMS" /> tag in class.tslib_pagegen.php to reflect version 3.7. Should be changed to something dynamic in the future! (see bug #0000318)
	* Fixed bug #0000365: Made comparing md5 hashes of t3x files in mod/tools/em/index.php ignore leading whitespaces. Patch by Martin T. Kutschker <Martin-no5pam-Kutschker@blackbox.n0spam.net>
	* Increasing version number to 3.7.0RC2

2004-09-15  Ingmar Schlecht  <ingmars@web.de>

	* Fixed bug #0000353: In typo3/wizard_add.php removed call to non-existing printContent() method. It doesn't need to print anything.

2004-09-14  Michael Stucki  <mundaun@gmx.ch>

	* Fixed bug #0000159: Logging did not work with absolute logfile_dir specified. However this will still work only if the specified path is within either PATH_site or lockRootPath.
	* The BE login screen now shows the sitename by default
	* Fixed a typo in config_default.php
	* Changed description for lockRootPath

2004-09-14  Ingmar Schlecht  <ingmars@web.de>

	* Fixed bug #0000111: Install tool now allows for database name, password and username to contain any kind of chars (not limited to alphanumerical any more).

2004-09-14  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Updated my email address from "kasper@typo3.com" (which is closed and will stay that way) to "kasperYYYY@typo3.com" which programmers should be able to figure out...
	* Updated all JavaDoc comments and function/class indexes in files, preparing for 3.7.0RC

2004-09-13  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added CSH for Web>Info/Localization Overview

2004-09-13  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Changed little more in uniqueList, among others that a fixed number of paramters are supported only now!

2004-09-13  Michael Stucki  <mundaun@gmx.ch>

	* Fixed bug in t3lib_div::uniqueList that was caused when t3lib_div::uniqueArray was replaced with array_unique. Obviously array_unique doesn't remove empty values from the array but t3lib_div::uniqueArray did! Please take care of this if you still use this deprecated function in your extension!

2004-09-11  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Updated changelog for 09/09
	* Fixed bug in stdgraphic::fontResize that made it go into eternal loops if the size could not be obtained in the lower end, basically when fontsize reached zero...
	* Fixed bug in alt_menu_functions which prevented Condensed Mode from working. But most likely it breaks something else, maybe some options around alternative navigation frame scripts that rene introduced.
	* Fixed a bug introduced yesterday where TYPO3 would not work with PHP versions below 4.100.0... :-) - clearly testifying to the fact that I have now run TYPO3 on PHP5 with TemplaVoila et al. for five days without problems.
	* Added new option for the dynamic tab menus where you can configure a free initial default tab index and even close all items totally (like toggle mode, but still with only one tab open at a time).
	* Increased levels of possible recursive permission setting to 10.
	* Web>Page: Introduced localization flags, removed move-up/down/new buttons for languages in default-content-binding mode and made the selection of default elements include the "All" language in default-content-binding mode which will correspond to how sys_language_overlay works in the frontend.
	* Introduced baseUrlWrap() function in tslib_fe (TSFE) which can be called for wrapping URLs with absolute baseUrl prefix in case you are using "realurl" of sorts. This is necessary to do for all urls that is handled by JavaScript, like "document.location" or "window.open" cases.
	* Fixed the realurl related bug with click-enlarged images that would open a non-existing URL (see "baseUrlWrap()" above). Also wrapped other JavaScript URls like in JSMENU and typolink related JSwindow action.
	* Introduced a global setting for GIFBUILDER TEXT objects to configure alternative font files for certain Unicode char ranges. This feature makes it very easy to set up eg. a japanese truetype font for all usages of GIFBUILDER where you still want another specific font used for the latin characters.
	* Introduced new HMENU feature: "alwaysActivePIDlist" which can configure certain page id which will always be expanded in menu as if they were "active".
	* Fixed problem with empty URLs in menu generation. Empty URLs may occur when a realurl points to the frontpage (which is a blank suffix to the base url). In such cases the URL now becomes the baseUrl of the site (if that is configured!). This should fix it very specifically for all realurl cases.
	* Fixed install tools incapability to delete files with certain prefixes in typo3temp/ folder.

2004-09-09  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>
Sorry for writing these changelog entries with a delay of two days. I write them based on a CVS patch and it took ages to make that from a parking lot in Suresnes, Paris, 4 am in the morning. Its becoming harder to find a stable hotspot in Paris I think... But here we go:
	* Changed all HTTP_*_VARS to $_* superglobals. Also raised PHP requirement version to 4.1.0
	* Added wrapping functions to array browser class. Also updated the Configuration module to use these features so you can now click a key and get a string served ready to implement in eg. localconf.php
	* !!! Removed obsolete function "t3lib_div::setGPvars()"
	* Added $MCONF['shy'] feature (requested by Rene Fritz)
	* Added longblob in sqlparser
	* Added configurable JPG quality setting to stdGraphic class. Use $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[GFX][im_jpg_quality]
	* Added stdgraphic::ImageTTFTextWrapper() and stdgraphic::ImageTTFBBoxWrapper functions. Behind these changes a new feature has been implemented which makes it possible to render a single GIFBUILDER TEXT object with more than one font file for various criteria. The most important criteria is that a certain range of unicode chars can be rendered using another truetype font supporting eg. japanese glyphs while you still use another specific font for the design of latin chracters. This feature is known as "splitRendering" in GIFBUILDER TEXT objects.
	* Added new swapping mode setting for versioning: swapContent = ALL which is what you use if you want to swap the SUBTREE of a page as well!
	* Fixed a bug in transferdata class where too many field values were returned in wrong situations.
	* Fixed the timetrack class whitespace issue, removed the DAM module key in stddb/tables.php and removed the temporary class "t3lib_TCEforms_SelectTreeView" made by Rene Fritz.
	* Implemented configurable session timeout for backend users.
	* Changed the TYPO3 version number variable into a constant available before ext_localconf.php files are included.
	* Added "location" bar to the re-login screen. Inspired by Johannes Reichart who once many years ago sent me a mail about how the login screen should be protected against someone designing a similar prompt to trick users into giving them their passwords. I couldn't find a better idea than making the URL visible so people can validate the domain themselves.
	* Added localization view mode in Web>List module, allowing to see localization details for records, grouping them by their language and providing a "localization copy" button.
	* Updated english labels for backend/CSH according to change suggestions by 3EV from UK. Thanks.
	* Added obTS specific hook in tslib_content class. For Dan Frost and his empire...
	* Impleemnted third option for stdWrap crop feature (by Peter Klein)
	* Fixed typolink that would reject links to virtual files and folders locally, eg. links made by realurl etc. Previously such files HAD to exist, otherwise the link would not be rendered.
	* Changed stuff around the pagenotfound handling.
	* moved <meta charset...> in frontend output to be the first tag after the <html> tag.
	* Fixed old bug in tslib_search which cropped off the last char of a search word.
	* Fixed extra_page_cm_options that didn't detect itself properly when making the second menu. So now the elements from that extension will NOT anymore pop up in other second level menus... :-)

2004-09-10  Michael Stucki  <mundaun@gmx.ch>

	* Replaced t3lib_div::uniqueArray with native PHP function array_unique. The old function will remain for compatibility reasons only. Please do not use it anymore!
	* Removed comment about the expired Unisys patent in class.tx_install.php

2004-09-00  Jan-Erik Revsbech    <jer@moccompany.com>
	* Fixed bug #292 concerning Return path in class.t3lib_mailer.php. The fix has a seperate solution for windows and Unix. The unix fix does however not work with safe_mode enabled. Do not know how to overcome this. Perhaps an environment variable for sendmail can be specified? The fix for windows works OK with safe_mode on since, it does not rely on passing parameter directly to the mailer tranport agent (Sendmail or postfix), but instead sets the php variable sendmail_from, which has no effect on Unix systemt.

2004-09-02  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed a few basic PHP5 problems (aiming at PHP5 support in 3.7.0)

2004-09-02  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* BTW; Just created a hook for page indexing which "indexed_search" will also be using in near future - BUT at the time of this writing it will require a new version of indexed_search for you and that is NOT ready yet - so indexed_search will NOT work for you anymore before you get the new version of this extension!

2004-09-02  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added Catalan, Bosnian and Korean languages.

2004-08-29  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added a wildcard like option for values in the "language" condition in frontend (matchcondition class). Can now match any language found in the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE value.

2004-08-29  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "lockIP" setting for backend users - this will solve the problem that some has reported about backend users not being able to login with 3.7.0...
	* Added new HMENU special type, "language", which can generate a language selector using the "&L" variable directly.
	* Added option for HMENU (protectLvar) so menu items linking to pages that are not translated will have their "&L" var set to zero, thus reverting to the default language.
	* Corrected a bug in menu generation: Spacers for TMENU had a link around it - this was a bug, correct now. No links on spacer elements!

2004-08-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Adding editlock icon in Web>Access

2004-08-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasperYYYY@typo3.com>

	* Bugfix: in browse_links where the record listing contained links to clickmenus:
	* Added "Save and View" support for records which has another language set; For instance content elements and page overlay records will now view the page with the "&L=xx" parameter set to the language they represent.
	* Version selector (implemented in template class) implemented in all Web>* modules (depends on "version" extension)
	* Support for versioning in Web>List module ("v" button) (depends on "version" extension)
	* Bugfix: In Web>List the page icon is restored. "Was lost, but now is found."
	* Bugfix: Fixed access control in the interface of the page module and wizard_rte; Now checks if user has proper permissions before displaying certain buttons. Not critical bug, but obviously confusing for users to see the editing forms like if they actually could edit...
	* Added view-page icons in Web>Page module for the language column view.
	* Added first support for versioning previews in the frontend (CONTENT and RECORD cObjects)
	* Implemented new localization modes configurable with TypoScript, "config.sys_language_overlay" and "config.sys_language_softMergeIfNotBlank"
	* Added automatic character set conversion of frontend output if metaCharset and renderCharset are different. Also incoming POST arrays are converted in the reverse direction.
	* Changed calling order of TSFE->getCompressedTCarray() in "index_ts.php": Now it loads before ->getConfigArray(). Should be no difference to anyone except internal processing in tslib_fe which can now access the array a little before it usually could.
	* Added t3lib_cs::convArray() for charset conversion of array contents.

2004-08-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Implemented versioning API in tcemain plus other places. Still not functional for the broad public (will be in 3.8.0). Missing conceptual testing, implementation in the backend interface (still to be discussed how that is best done and fitting workflow) and not at all in the frontend.
	* Tables configured for versioning by default is pages, tt_content, pages_language_overlay and sys_template
	* !!!Notice that the type of integer for uid/pid fields of the above mentioned tables changed from "unsigned" to "signed". This should only mean something if you have uid/pid values over 2 billion - but then PHP will fail you anyways. So the impact should be nothing.
	* For testers: Ask me (kasper) for the "version" extension which is my test bench and future management tool for the final implementation.
	* !!!Fieldnames 't3ver_oid', 't3ver_id' and 't3ver_label' has been reserved for versioning adminstration

2004-08-22  Ingmar Schlecht  <ingmars@web.de>

	* Changed the way how the EM and the Kickstarter interact
		-> Removed all hardcoded references to the Kickstarter from the index.php of the EM and changed it to be extendable using the "Integrate into existing modules" functionality.
		-> Removed the file typo3/mod/tools/em/class.kickstarter.php
		The new version of the Kickstarter that uses these new ways of interaction has the new extension key 'kickstarter' and is already available from typo3xdev CVS.
		The old version of the Kickstarter having the key 'extrep_wizard' is not used anymore.

2004-08-21  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added support for backend initialization in PHP shell scripts. Interesting for deamons, cronjobs etc where you want a PHP script to run from shell but with a full backend environment. Documented in next version of Inside TYPO3.
	* Configurable multiplication of DB field size (useful for resizing database for UTf-8 support)
	* Fixed bug in show_item.php script / stdGraphic with abs/rel path prefix and typo3temp/ folder.
	* TCEforms/TCEmain support for localization; You can exclude certain fields in localized versions, see diff. view if original changed, see the original records content with the localized version.
	* TCEforms support for dynamic TAB menus (use the --div-- in types configuration and enable in [ctrl] section
	* All TCEforms changes for localization and tab menus are documented in TYPO3 Core API
	* Added support for localization-copies in Web>Page module; Now you can create copies of default language elements with a click on a button. There is even a new mode where all localizations must follow the default language 100% - but this still lacks frontend support. Enabled by "web.layout.defLangBinding=1" in Page TSconfig.
	* Finally implemented dynamic (DHTML based) tab menus for flexforms using sheets!
	* Added "select all" link for "checkbox" renderMode of "select" types in TCEforms
	* New tcemain "cmd": "localize". Will make a localization-copy of a record, eg. content elements.
	* Made "explicitDeny" mode for backend users configurable in TYPo3_CONF_VARS as requested on the dev-list.
	* Added "sleep(5)" when a false login was detected in the login-screen. This makes trying lots of username/passwords in the login screen boooooring...
	* Added new GUI type: Dynamic TAB menu which can switch between a number of sheets of content dynamically with tabs. Used in flexforms and also in TemplaVoila.
	* Set-locale issue for USER_INT objects should be fixed. Please test this someone!!!


2004-08-20  Ingmar Schlecht  <ingmars@web.de>

 * Marginally changed the error message in t3lib_userauth appearing when the HTTP_REFERER mismatched.

2004-08-20  Ingmar Schlecht  <ingmars@web.de>

 * Corrected wrong parameter order for some implode function calls.

2004-08-07  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Added three new permission modes for backend users: 1) Localization access control, 2) Access control on value level (for instance allow/deny individual selectorbox values), 3) API for custom permission options.
 * Implemented control of these modes in tcemain, tceforms and alt_doc.php + QuickEdit. Still need to implement it for edit icons around, but this is not critical, mostly a usability issue.
 * Moved table "sys_language" from extension "cms" back into the core
 * Updated CSH at various places.
 * Finished the accessListRenderMode(s) (see 4/8 below)
 * Still unsettled about various default settings related to these new options, but will discuss on dev-list.

2004-08-04  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Added new rendering modes for the "select" type in TCA: You can now render multiple-select lists as either a SINGLE selector box with multiple value selection OR as a list of checkboxes. For mozilla even the icons are rendered nicely in the option tags. Check out the backend user group configurations. Work is still in progress.

2004-08-04  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Added TYPo3_CONF_VARS[FE][lockHashKeyWords] so it is optional to lock FE user sessions to HTTP_USER_AGENT

2004-08-03  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Added and Changed features around page languages. More to come including a document guiding people about charsets and localization.

2004-07-24  Jan-Erik Revsbech <jer@moccompany.com>
 * Added support for other transfer encodings in the dmailer class. Will start to move the t3lib_directmailer class out of the core and into the direct_mail extension.

2004-07-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Added the Core CVS rules to repository at "misc/core_cvs_rules.txt". ALL Contributers to the CORE CVS SHOULD READ AND FOLLOW THIS!

2004-07-15  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

 * Added new language flag icons (see t3lib/gfx/flags/). Will be used by templavoila and maybe sys_language

2004-07-12  Ingmar Schlecht  <ingmars@web.de>

 * Fixed bug #194: wizard_table.php, missing parameter 'backPath'

2004-07-12  Ingmar Schlecht  <ingmars@web.de>

 * Fixed bug #0000191: Small typo in German translation

2004-06-28  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Moved creation of menu graphics, scaled images, gifbuilder images and temporary image files into subfolders of typo3temp/
 * Fixed case-folding-cache-file bug in t3lib_cs...
 * select a filepath as a source of the items you can add to the box (single/multiple) without copying the files of course.

2004-06-21  Michael Stucki  <mundaun@gmx.ch>

 * Fixed bug #0000119: Another fe_adminLib htmlspecialchars() issue

2004-06-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Moved CSH locallang-XML labels into extensions prefixed "csh_".

2004-06-18  Michael Stucki  <mundaun@gmx.ch>

	* Fixed bug #0000032: ImageMagick will convert only the first page of a multi-page PDF file

2004-06-11  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Created new hook in class.t3lib_tcemain.php in process_datamap. Search for $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SC_OPTIONS']['t3lib/class.t3lib_tcemain.php']['processDatamapClass']
	(other hooks in that class will follow by René, as I know from a trusted source ... ;-)

2004-06-09  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Fixed bug #0000123:
		The stdWrap-option "stripHtml" should come before the option "crop" because HTML-Tags are recognized as Text by the crop-option but getafterwards stript out. That produces a wrong textlength.
		Changed order of "crop" to after "stripHTML"
		Affected file: class.tslib_content.php

2004-06-08  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Fixed bug #0000070: Number of files (file count) displayed in file list module was one number too high ("5 Files" although 4 only exist). Updated typo3/class.file_list.inc
	* Changed one line in media/scripts/plaintextLib.inc which caused a "page not found" in some e-mail clients.

2004-06-06  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Changed all locallang files from "lang" system extension into the new locallang-XML format instead. Includes changes to a bunch of core scripts which had to include the new files with an API function from the $LANG object.

2004-06-06  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "groupChangeMask" option in TYPO3_CONF_VARS - makes it possible to set which group newly created files and folders will get. (Thanks to Stucki)

2004-06-03  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added API for configuring tables (ending on "cache") that are flushed together with "Clear All Cache".
	* Fixed that the Admin Panel is always on top (z-index : 0;

2004-06-03  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added base url to typo3 error dialog in frontend. Means it shows logo when using realurls now.
	* Added "READFILE:" prefix for pageNotFound handler in frontend; This will read the contents of an html file and output with substitution of a few marker strings.
	* Added feature in page tree; Temporary mounting a point in the users page tree as root. (available in the "More options..." - needs upgrade of that extension as well...).
	* Fixed frontend edit icons under real-url conditions. They didn't work in MSIE. Had to prefix them with base url.

2004-05-29  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed bug; All page types (doktype) was shown to uses even if they were not all in their list of possible type values.

2004-05-29  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Created a new DEFAULT backend module called "manual". It shows a TOC of CSH items from the system. This will provide a "user sensitive" manual inside of TYPO3 with localized content to the extend that translators has translated CSH labels in the system. The vision is that the Documentation Team will develop CSH content so far that this will become a really good inline reference for users of TYPO3. Also, extension authors are encouraged to implement CSH for their tables and backend modules and let that be the user manual for their products!

2004-05-28  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added new CSH entries at various places using a new method in t3lib_BEfunc. The CSH entries are still empty and needs to be completed.

2004-05-28  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added visual response to backend module selection in the menus; The class attribute of the menu items is changed when a module is selected. The default stylesheet is modified so this results in the current module being highlighted in the menu.

2004-05-27  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed various things in file processing, t3lib_extFileFunc et al.

2004-05-24  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added API for custom RTE transformations. Documented in upcoming "TYPO3 Core API".

2004-05-20  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed remaining issues with styles in the backend regarding the TCEforms. There has been added additional possibilities of styling forms, now with classes in stylesheets, using $TBE_STYLES to set them up. Documentation of $TBE_STYLES for TCeforms has been updated in TYPo3 Core Api as well.

2004-05-20  Ingmar Schlecht  <ingmars@web.de>

	* Fixed two install tool bugs:
		#83: On non open_basedir'ed systems check if IM executables exist before trying to execut them.
		#95: Use ini_get() instead of get_cfg_var()

2004-05-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed stylesheet issues in Extension Manager.

2004-05-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Finally fixed typo3/show_item.php and typo3/wizard_colorpicker.php scripts for TYPO3 3.6.0 compliance. Now only extensions and some t3lib/ are missing clean-up.

2004-05-18  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>
	* Added t3lib_cs::specCharsToASCII() for converting special chars (like umlauts) to their double-byte alternatives in ASCII (like au, oe etc...). Function is NOT finished at all, only added so I could use it for the conversion of filenames in simulateStaticDocuments.
	* TypoScript charset compatibility extended: tslib_cObj::caseshift(), tslib_cObj::substring(), tslib_cObj::crop() uses functions in t3lib_cs now. Also stdWrap.strftime will automatically convert localized string from locale charset (guessed by t3lib_cs) to renderCharset.
	* !!! website charset is now taken from "forceCharset" by default (if found) and in any case the http-header with text/html and charset is sent UNLESS you disable it with "config.disableCharsetHeader=1". You will probably have to disable this header if you are using TYPO3 for XML feeds or wap-pages.
	* Added "config.renderCharset" option: This is the charset of the content while rendered in the frontend engine. If different from "metaCharset" a conversion must happen before output to browser. Both renderCharset and metaCharset takes their default values from TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][forceCharset] if found, otherwise they default to "iso-8859-1". Also "metaCharset" takes "renderCharset" as default - and if metaCharset is different from renderCharset a conversion will happen on output.

2004-05-18  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Created new function, t3lib_div::fixed_lgd_cs(), which should be used in the backend wherever a string is shortend for visual display. This function will truncate the string according to the backend charset (which should of course be set by forceCharset to a fixed value). This new function has also been substituted numerous places in the source of course (hence all the script updates).

2004-05-17  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Moved "install" extension to be a sys extension in sysext/

2004-05-17  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Corrected some bugs in t3lib_cs while writing a unit test for it.

2004-05-15  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Splitted the Install Tool interface parts out from t3lib_install into the class tx_install (in extension "install"). Only things left are logic to update localconf.php files and manage SQL / Database (for Extension Manager).

2004-05-11  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Changed version number to 3.7.0-dev according to newly adopted major.minor.patch version numbering model.

2004-05-11  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Merged branch changes from "TYPO3_3-6-0"; Mainly bugfixes by ingmar.

2004-05-11  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Rolled back browser detection in matchcondition class.

2004-05-07  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "relPathprefix" to TEMPLATE cObject and also added support for relative path substitution of references in url() wrappers in <style> tags. This will also fix THAT problem reported for automaketemplate.

2004-04-30  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Merged TYPO3_3-6-0 branch changes by robert into HEAD. See 3.6.0 branch change log if you want.

2004-04-27  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* TAG: "TYPO3_3-6-0RC2", BRANCH "TYPO3_3-6-0"

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added possibility to prefix references to wizard scripts with "EXT:" for reference to wizard scripts in extension.

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added prefix to relative file reference in @import style sheet

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed bug where DB mounts for a user which has been deleted would still show up in the page tree.

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed bug with pageNotFound handling.

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added a PAGE Tsconfig option to disable the automatic clearing of page cache when records are edited.

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Updated "cms" extension with most recent labels from TYPO3.org

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Updated "lang" extension with most recent labels from TYPO3.org

2004-04-26  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added Latvian, Japanese and Vietnamese languages

2004-04-24  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added to TypoScript object browser that the title text of the object links contains information about in which lines in the TypoScript body code that a certain object path is set, cleared, copied.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "removeBadHTML" option to stdWrap - this can help to avoid XSS dangerous HTML.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added feature in TYpoScript data type "getText" to get values from GET arrays via "GPvar" key word. Now you can specify ".date = GPvar : tx_myext|mode|index" to get value of &tx_myext[mode][index]

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added option "$TYPO3_CONF_VARS["GFX"]["gdlib_2"] = 'no_imagecopyresized_fix';" to avoid using the imagecopyresized workaround in stdgraphic class which has failed for some. Whether the workaround is needed anymore is not certain. Some people say it works fine without.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added TypoScript condition "hostname" for matching hostnames for IP addresses.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added API for configuring extra tables/fields for listing in Web > Page

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added option "mod.web_list.clickTitleMode = edit/info/show" to determine alternative behaviours of title links in the Web > List module.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added Page TSconfig option "mod.web_list.listOnlyInSingleTableView = 1" which makes the List module list only the table names by default. You have to click the table name to get the single-table view before records show up. This is useful for pages containing many records from many tables.

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added refresh button to taskcenter (not in core CVS)

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "Login failure" message in backend login box

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added to user authentication that the HTTP_USER_AGENT is hashed and a part of the session lookup (in other words, if the HTTP_USER_AGENT stays constant the session stays as well). Also added possibility of configuring that the IP adresse used to lock down sessions is only part 1,2,3 or 4 (all) used. Mainly this is easily configurable for frontend users (which has had the "security level" set to "2" now instead of disabled totally!). For backend users I didn't make configuration options in TYPO3_CONF_VARS - just wanted to know if people needed it there first (not to bloat options....)

2004-04-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added possibility of jumping directly to editing a page in the backend. You specify "alt_main.php?edit=[page id]" and you will be brought directly to the page edit module.

2004-04-22  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added in RTE link box: Searched *into* Content ELements of type Text and Text w/Image after anchors (<a name="...">) and lists them as well with content elements to which an anchor link can be made.

2004-04-22  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added configuration options for what level of pages cache is cleared when you edit a page header. You can not get children and grand-parents cleared as well. (TCEMAIN.clear..... in Page TSconfig)

2004-04-21  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "altText" and "titleText" attributes to the IMGMAP object (used for IMGMENU: Now you can add values to the alt and title attributes of image maps).
	* Added "ATagTitle" attribute for TMENU / GMENU so the menu links can have a title attribute for accessible websites.
	* Added "allStdWrap" attributes for TMENUITEM/GMENU item states. + some other properties requested.

2004-04-21  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added features around "includeCSS" TypoScript property for PAGE objects: "import" and "alternate" attributes (booleans) are now supported.

2004-04-20  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Changed a bunch of things, added a few new features to make TYPO3 accessible. One significant thing was the attributes "altText", "titleText" and "longdescURL" for IMAGE, IMGTEXT, FILE and ->filelink() in TypoScript.

2004-04-20  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Completed changes for XHTML compliance requests from the Accessibility group. Mainly adding support for more XHTML types, adding attributes like xml:lang to <html> tag, support for "dir" attributes in HTML tags, support for writing inline styles and JavaScript to a temporary file to keep a clean HTML <head> section...

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* "minItems", "maxItems" and "begin" has been added as properties to MENU objects (like TMENU, GMENU, IMGMENU etc) so you can set these values for the individual menus (as they probably should have been in the first place...).

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added a checkbox to the page header in the "cms" extension called "Hide in menu". With this checkbox the page is excluded from menus on the totally same terms as doktype=5 ("Not in menu") does. The implementation is believed to be complete (although there might be some places overlooked). The checkbox renders the doktype 5 "Not in menu" obsolete; the idea is that the checkbox should be used in the future. Finally - if anyone read this far - I prophecise, that within two weeks from this moment someone will approach me and want to have a visual response to the "Hide in menu" checkbox in the icon; currently the page icon does NOT change it looks (and it would be very doubtful if we could justify making it change...).

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added new FORM cObject type, "label", which inserts a label instead of a field. Also fixed ordering problem when the "dataArray" attribute of FORM is used (now renders the form in the numerical order of the elements instead of order of appearance).

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed incompatibility between Mount Points and property "overrideId" in menus.

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added support for JavaScript regular expression evaluation in FORM cObject. Means that fields in formmails can now be checked for a pattern and not only for "required".

2004-04-19  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added possibility to copy database/file elements attached to records; You can now click the icon of these elements in the editing forms and get a (limited) context menu for these elements.
	* Fixed some other bugs around.

2004-04-16  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* fixed detection of schemes (http://, ftp:// etc) in "typolinks". Now email addresses are detected only if NOT prepended with a scheme. Also the presence of a scheme will make typolink function detect the input as a plain URL which should just be passed through untouched.

2004-04-14  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Mount Points (Mount pages) reworking:
Changelog:
Fixed bugs in Mount Points / Status:
- Added protection against forging the MP variable value; The exact number of MP var parts must exist, mountpoints cannot exist in rootline (must be resolved) etc.
- Fixed false detection of CUR, ACT etc. states in HMENU (including x_LAYERS menus)
- Added support for typolink linking to closest page in rootline (thus detecting Mounts)
- Fixed support for correct MP-vars for any entryLevel number for HMENU
- Added option to overlay the mount point with the mounted page; This means the mount point gets substituted with the mounted page and not only the subpages of the mounted page. This is called "Overlay" mode. Can be set on a per-mount level (checkbox in the pages record). Only doktypes < 200 can be mounted in overlay mode.
- Checked consistency of exclude pages/hidden/starttime/endtime and found it to be ok.
- HMENU special types supported:
	rootline : full support
	list,directory : Supported, but only if the ID values supplied are in the main rootline of the site. The pages in the menus are allowed to be mount points of course. If the supplied IDs are outside the rootline they will loose their connection to the rootline unless "config.MP_mapRootPoints" is configured to supply some mapping.
	browse : Not supported: Didn't have time to do it, but should be possible to implement technically.
	keyword/updated : Supported.
- Support for chained mount points; A mount point can mount another mount point. "Substitute Mount Point (this page) with Mounted page:" (overlay mode) is evaluated based on the LAST mountpoint in chain. In overlay mode enableFields are evaluated for the Mounted page while in normal mode it is evaluated for the mount point.
- Fixed problem with caching of the same page id with various MP vars; The page in the "cache_pageSection" table had to be identified by a combination of page id and MPvar.
- No support for Page "shortcut" mode: You cannot successfully make a shortcut to a mounted page. Support is currently not planned.
- Support added for search in mount pages; basically this is done since tslib_cObj::getTreeList() is now including MountPages as well! Since getTreeList() does not return any information about MPvars for an ID (its only a list of ids!) then you should enable "config.MP_mapRootPoints = root" or so - otherwise the mounted page ids will not obtain the necessary "MP" var.
- links to mount points re-maps themselves to right title/uid


2004-04-05  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Modified typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/class.tslib_content.php:
		* fixed bug: When providing an imgList for the IMGTEXT TLO, no spaces were accepted in the comma separated list. Now using t3lib_div::trimExplode for splitting.
		* fixed bug: The alt and title parameters have not been set correctly when using IMGTEXT with the imgList property. Now everything works as expected: You may specify alt/title texts for the whole IMGTEXT, or for each imgObj independently

	* Added support for automatically caching image dimensions instead of executing IM identify.  Original extension provided by Michael Stucki.
		* Affected files: t3lib/class.t3lib_stdgraphic.php, typo3/sysext/cms/ext_tables.sql
		* Tested by Ingmar, Michael and Robert

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed problem with domain look-up when an extra "/" was added to eg. "typo3.com//" -> showing "typo3.org" instead

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed some browser detection bugs in t3lib_matchcondition and t3lib_div. Not necessarily exhaustive! For instance a report on Netscape 7.2 being wrongly detected may not be resolved (need teh value of HTTP_USER_AGENT to solve it since I do not have netscape 7.2!)

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added full safety for the internal TYPO3 formmail; email addresses in the fields "recipient" and "recipient_copy" are encrypted in the transfer and the "formmail" interface is safe for spam-misuse (since a proper recipient address cannot be forged automatically).
!!!If someone are using the "formmail" API from other renderers than the FORM cObject in TypoScript you will have to set the recipient address to the encrypted value by default OR alternatively disabled the check by TYPO3_CONF_VARS[FE][strictFormmail] = FALSE

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added Jens Ellerbrocks suggestion for "postUserFuncInt" in stdWrap.

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added some file icons from Ben and Emile

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "General Plugin" to content elmeent wizard list.

2004-04-01  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed SSL problem and many other minor things

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed spam-protection of email adresses inserted by "mailto:..." in text.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed another small bug in detection of simulateStaticDocuments.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed distinction between ' and " in EM.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Removed "onblur" handler in "browser.php" - had no great significance apparently and bugged people on Mac.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* In t3lib_div::linkThisUrl(), remove "?" if no parameters were found.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added "config.doctype = none" support - omits any doctype in the frontend.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed an error for form wizard (and others...) where the return URL would be wrong if the wizard was activated right after having saved a new record (would like back to a new record again).
	* Further, I added the option of xmlOutput from the table and form wizards. This option is configured in the wizard setup. There is NO frontend rendering supporting the XML format yet. But it might be very handy (and recommended) for other applications wanting to use the table and formwizards.

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Changed the way simulateStaticDocuments are resolved

2004-03-28  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Changed "t3lib_div::calluserFunc" and t3lib_div::getUserObj to use "&" as token for persistent (global) objects rather than ">" - PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CODE if you happend to use these features already (less than a week old).

2004-03-24  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added <span title=""> to path in backend modules in Web main module; you can now see the full path (non-truncated) as title text.

2004-03-24  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added RTE API and changed the "rte" extension to use that.
	* Added t3lib_div::getUserObj() which returns an OBJECT , instead of executing a method call like callUserFunc() does.

2004-03-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed problem in Extension Manager where files and directories was not written with correct permissions. I also added t3lib_div::mkdir() general function for creating directories.

2004-03-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed bug that page tree didn't unfold when entering page id in the shortcut frame.

2004-03-23  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Added a checkbox for be-users to disable IP locking. This is useful if you have backend users complaining about being thrown off sessions.

[RC2 note:
As usual the changelog is not at all "complete" in terms of what has been changed. I regret this, but the tradeoff would be slower development if all details had to go in here which is why they don't.
However all IMPORTANT changes that might break compatibility somewhere is always entered in the log with "!!!" prefixed.
- kasper
]

- Modified how external URLs for pages are redirected to: In case the URL seems to be *relative* ("blabla/index.php", "?id=12..") the URL is prefixed with the site URL. Otherwise it won't work with "realurl" extension.
- Added features in t3lib_div::callUserFunction(); You can not specify objects to be instantiated once and stored globally for reuse (simply change "->" to "->>") and you can additionally specify a class file to include as a prefix to the method/function reference.
- Added a new constant "TYPO3_DLOG" which is tied to TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][enable_DLOG] and t3lib_div::devLog function; the framework provides possibility of implementing logging calls all over the source code, both frontend and backend with a minimum loss of speed if no logging is asked for and with the possibility of better debugging/tracking for developers
- Added some new options to array2xml to obtain XML creation from arrays which observes PHP data types and has options for better protection of tag names etc. Fixed a bug in the detection of binary data in arrays for base64 encoding as well.
- Script "tslib/media/scripts/makeMenu_keywords_updated.inc has been removed since it was obsolete.
- Fixed problem with references in FlexForms! Now all references gets correct when copying a page and images will also be copied.

Generally:
- Database Wrapper class "t3lib_DB" has been created, containing simple wrapper functions for MySQL and query building functions.

!!! - tslib_content::getUpdateJS()		Is NEVER stripping off slashes now, please update your code in extensions if you rely on this (most unlikely)
!!! - tslib_content::DBgetInsert() + tslib_content::DBgetUpdate() 	Will ALWAYS apply slashes to values in queries now (for security). If you use these functions in your extensions, please update your code to the new situation! (These two functions now use their counterparts in t3lib_DB class)
!!! - IP locking has been added to user sessions: For backend this is DEFAULT (which means that users might experience to be logged out if their IP changes dynamically during a session!) and for frontend users it is disabled by default (but can be enabled from TYPO3_CONF_VARS)
!!! - t3lib_BEfunc::DBcompileInsert() and t3lib_BEfunc::DBcompileUpdate() has been modified so they ALWAYS add slashes to values inserted in queries. (Further they are depreciated now since they just call their counterparts in t3lib_DB class.)
- Implemented t3lib_DB class as a first step towards database abstraction. For now it contains wrapper functions that ALL code should use in the future.
!!! - tslib_cObj::DBcompileInsert has been removed since it was obsolete.

25/2:
!!!- Removed global extension "Extrep"

2004-03-19  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

- Fixed SQL statement (missing quotes) in t3lib_dmailer, reported by Martin Erichsen.
  See: http://typo3.org/1422+M55c87d9b3b8.0.html'

2004-02-12  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	*
Made changes to class.tslib_content.php:
- added function getAltParam () which acts as an abstraction method / API creating alt and title parameters for img tags
- added a new TypoScript configuration property: "titleText" (string / stdWrp) similar to "altText". If only altText is specified, it will also be used for the "title" parameter
- used getAltParam in IMGTEXT () for rendering the alt tag
- used getAltParam in cImage () for rendering the alt tag
- added title="" when neccessary, ie. all cleargifs havin an alt="" parameter now also have a title=""


Kasper Skårhøj, 6/2:
 - Added processing option to RTE, "proc.plainImageMode"
 - Added options for select and group types in TCA to set the selector box style.
 - Added $altPageId parameter to function linkTP*() in tslib_pibase + pi_list_linkSingle()
 - Changed the order of <?xml> and <!DOCTYPE> in the frontend for XHTML around again. And added an option, "doctypeSwitch" which will reverse the order for those needing that. And finally the "doctype" option fed with a value that is not "xhtml_frames", "xhtml_trans" or "xhtml_strict" will be outputted AS the doctype!
 - Implemented checkbox for show thumbnails in Element browser/file and RTE select image dialog.
 - Implemented pop-up window size selector in link wizard


Kasper Skårhøj
	* Removed "mininews" from global extensions - that was an error in RC1
	* Removed global extensions "beuser_tracking/ classic_welcome/ design_components/ tt_links/" from main distribtion. They are either obsolete or irrelevant and it has been considered responsible to remove them like this.

2003-12-23  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Added another TSconfig option for replacing the create new content wizard (-> templavoila). Only added a few lines.

20/12: Change the backend icon processing: Not, by default icons are NOT processed with overlay of hidden, start/endtime icons; The icons are found preprocessed with the source icon. This can be disabled so the old behaviour will apply, see TYPO3_CONF_VARS[GFX] - however group-numbers on icons have been permanently disabled.

Fixed all:
- Click menu does not work in task-center/weblist
- admin-only flag in TYPO3_CONF_VARS so only administrators can log in/be authenticated.
- Click menu does not work in Opera.
- BUG: Row-highlighting for both Page and Folder trees are not stable enough.
- BUG: when editing records from Web>View the palette will not show properly in the topframe!
- BUG: Email forms wizard: "Checked: " for checkboxes does not work!
- BUG: File>List , list-frame: Click menu does NOT work in Mozilla! cannot find the bug!
- Convert selecting of filemounts from GROUP selector to a selectorbox.
- Option: Frameset modules without the "border" frame and therefore adjustable freely.
Changed all usage of t3lib_div::GPvar('SET') to t3lib_div::GPvar('SET',1) (stripping slashes) where its used to set MOD_SETTINGS for backend modules.

2003-12-16  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Added and changed some features related to the replacement of default page module by a custom one (templavoila). See t3lib_positionmap, t3lib_tsfebeuserauth, alt_shortcut, alt_clickmenu

2003-12-16  Kasper Skårhøj

	* Added new languages labels for cms and lang extensions // increased version number to 3.6.0RC1

2003-12-16  Kasper Skårhøj
	* Changed order of DOCTYPE and XML declaration for XHTML support (for standards compliance mode detection in MSIE)
2003-10-24  Kasper Skårhøj
	* Moved changelog.txt to ChangeLog ("cvs compliant")
TYPO3 3.6.0-dev
PHP:
!!! $LANG->php3Lang + ->mainLang has been cancelled and replaced with a local-lang call: Search/replace regex: search for '->php3Lang\["([^]]*)"\]\["([^]]*)"\]', replace with '->sL("LLL:EXT:lang/locallang_core.php:\1.\2")'. Same for ->mainLang.
!!! The global var $AB has been removed (since the "alternative backend" is now THE backend and the classic is totally gone. If you use this var, you can safely expect $AB's value to be TRUE and therefore remove all code which would excute if it was FALSE.
!!! Removed what looked like unused functions and variables in the backend frameset JavaScript.
!!! Change db_list_frame and file_list_frame to just "list_frame".
!!! Cleaned up a lot in the template-class.
!!! dfw() and rfw() functions must be substituted with $GLOBALS["TBE_TEMPLATE"]->dfw() / ->rfw()
!!! fw() is highly depreciated (and does NOT wrap strings anymore!)
!!! if (top.theMenu) top.theMenu.recentuid
!!! Constant "PATH_temp" has been cancelled - no scripts seemed to use it and the dir is depreciated.
!!! typo3/temp/ has been cancelled. Changed to typo3/icons/ for STATIC icons and PATH_site.typo3temp/ is now used for the locally generated icons. So no more typo3/temp/ to be writable.
!!! t3lib_BEfunc::loadTablesDescriptions() and t3lib_BEfunc::loadSingleTableDescription is removed. A function call like t3lib_BEfunc::loadSingleTableDescription("pages",$LANG->lang); is substituted with $LANG->loadSingleTableDescription("pages");
!!! Function t3lib_BEfunc::pTypes() remove - nothing used it (apparently. prove me wrong... :-)
!!! Function t3lib_div::extParseurl removed
!!! Function t3lib_div::imagefinder, t3lib_div::linkfinder, t3lib_div::getStrippedURL, t3lib_div::getMimeType, t3lib_div::debug_white_space, t3lib_div::debug_code, t3lib_div::parsetime, t3lib_div::hardspace, t3lib_div::break_text, t3lib_div::unbreak_text removed
!!! The font files "arial.ttf" and "verdana.ttf" has been removed from the folder t3lib/fonts/ and substituted with similar typefaces, "nimbus.ttf" and "vera.ttf" respectively.
!!! The script "t3lib/formmail.php" has been removed. Was not used and didn't work anyways.
!!! The classes t3lib_pagetree and t3lib_browsetree has been divided into four new classes (folder,page,browse + treeview) - and as a rule of thumb, the API has been modified so much that you should rather check all you applications using these classes in DETAIL! Consider it a reimplementation.
!!! The three rte_*.php scripts in TYPO3 core has been moved TO the "rte" extension! This also means that any extension classes must have updated their XCLASS registration keys to the new file positions.
!!! status_file.php is gone...
!!! The typo3/ scripts db_new_content_el.php and db_layout.php has been moved into the sysext/cms/layout/ folder. Further, the classes have been remodelled a lot. If you link to these scripts or extend their classes in your applications, you should observe the compatibility!
Charsets:
- A new class "t3lib_cs" has been added. It contains homemade functions for conversion to and from a list of charsets (conversion tables found in t3lib/csconvtbl/). The conversion could be speeded up enourmously by using PHP functions but I simply didn't find any that could be used. By time we can substitute the PHP-processing with internal PHP functions if possible.
- In TYPO3_CONF_VARS we can now set up a system charset. [BE][forceCharset] This is used a) for storage of information and b) for whole backend. Default is that charset of the current user (as always), but clearly recommended is "UTF-8"!!!
	- The recommendation is that the forceCharset configuration is used for multilingual sites. In this way the SAME charset is ALWAYS used in the backend regardless of which language the current backend user has chosen. Thus all content in the sysmte is stored in the same charset.
