default:
  # Always retry a failed job, so it has a chance to recover from a faulty machine or timing issue
  retry: 1
  # Any job taking longer than this is considered 'failed'
  timeout: 30m

cache:
  # Default caching of .cache directory if a job does not override it.
  # General rule: Keep them as small as possibles since that is less unpack work.
  # Jobs that do the same thing, should use the same key. Jobs that derivate from
  # defaults, should have an own cache.
  # Examples: master-composer, master-composer-js, master-composer-min-js, 10.4-composer
  # For job runtime, it does not matter much if there are many caches,
  # it is more important that single jobs don't unpack too much every time.
  # The default key is: "Cache everything created by a 'composer install' for master branch.
  # This means jobs using this default key should not create additional stuff in .cache
  # directory, for instance by calling a 'yarn install' or 'composer min' or similar.
  key: 10.4-composer
  paths:
    - .cache

services:
  # Each job starts two containers: This dind container that starts a docker
  # daemon, plus a casual container that executes runTests.sh for single jobs
  # to start containers within the dind container.
  - name: docker:19.03-dind
    alias: docker

# This is *never* overridden in single jobs. All jobs start a 'dind' service
# so runTests.sh starts 'sub' containers within the dind container, and this
# main entry point container executes runTests.sh to start containers.
