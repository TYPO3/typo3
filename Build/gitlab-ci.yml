variables:
  # When a branch derives from main or 10.4 or something, composer stumbles
  # if the repos has been 'shallow cloned', can't determine the source branch
  # and fails with package conflicts. Having a full clone by setting depth 0
  # prevents this, so we don't need to fiddle with COMPOSER_ROOT_VERSION env var.
  GIT_DEPTH: 0
  # The `--pull=never` flag must not be removed.
  # All images used by CI-jobs have to be preloaded on the TYPO3 testing
  # infrastructure to avoid exceeding rate limits for docker.io or ghcr.io.
  CI_PARAMS: "--pull=never"

cache:
  # Default caching of .cache directory if a job does not override it.
  # General rule: Keep them as small as possibles since that is less unpack work.
  # Jobs that do the same thing, should use the same key. Jobs that derivate from
  # defaults, should have an own cache.
  # Examples: main-composer, main-composer-js, main-composer-min-js, 10.4-composer
  # For job runtime, it does not matter much if there are many caches,
  # it is more important that single jobs don't unpack too much every time.
  # The default key is: "Cache everything created by a 'composer install' for main branch.
  # This means jobs using this default key should not create additional stuff in .cache
  # directory, for instance by calling a 'npm ci' or 'composer min' or similar.
  key: 13.4-composer
