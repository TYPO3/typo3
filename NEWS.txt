===============================================================================
Compatibility
===============================================================================

* Refactored bootstrap

With a bootstrap refactoring the index.php file located in the document root of
the installation was changed. If you are running a typo3 core source with a
symlink, make sure that this file is also a symlink to the cores index.php,
otherwise the frontend will be broken. If index.php is a copy of the source
file, make sure to install a fresh version from 6.0 sources.

* New handling of typo3conf/localconf.php

The localconf.php file is deprecated and not used in the core any longer. As
substitution the new file typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php is introduced that
basically only returns the local configuration as array. The install tool and
other installation changing core code like the extension manager now writes
the whole file if configuration is changed. As a result, no more local
code is allowed in this file.
To overload the local configuration with special instance specific code that
might still be needed, it is possible to add the php code to the optional
additional file typo3conf/AdditionalConfiguration.php that is executed during
bootstrap of TYPO3 after LocalConfiguration.php.
An ugrade wizard takes care of moving the old localconf.php file to the new scheme.

* List of loaded extensions stored as array

The list of loaded extensions in typo3conf/LocalConfiguration (key EXT/extList)
was transferred to an array for better readability and maintenance. It is
available with the new key EXT/extListArray. The old, comma separated value is
still kept, but not used in the core anymore. It will be removed with a later
version from the core.

* Moved default TYPO3_CONF_VARS

The default TYPO3_CONF_VARS definitions where moved from t3lib/config_default.php
to an own file in t3lib/stddb/DefaultSettings.php.

* Removed TYPO3_tables_script constant

It was possible to define a different base TCA definition file by defining the
variable typo_db_tables_script in localconf.php. This functionality is removed
without substitution.

* Restricted access of global variables in ext_tables.php and ext_localconf.php

With the bootstrap refactoring the visibility of ext_tables.php and
ext_localconf.php was reduced. The files do not run in global context anymore,
so variables like $TCA should be accessed through $GLOBALS['TCA']. There is a
compatibility layer, but the core can not guarantee that extensions with
strange setup does not break.

* Deprecated methods

Deprecated methods that were initially targeted to be removed in TYPO3 4.8/6.0
have finally been removed. The deprecation log shows which functions were
declared to be deprecated and will be removed in the next TYPO3 versions.

* Removed classes prior to scheduled deprecation removal

t3lib_BEDisplayLog: This class was used only by the old belog module, its
functionality is now encapsulated in EXT:belog itself. Since it is very
unlikely that the class was used by other external extensions, the file was
removed instead of deprecating it.

* New XCLASS handling

The old way of registering XCLASSes in $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[TYPO3_MODE]['XCLASS'] is
removed. XCLASSES must now be registered by adding a 'ux_' prefixed entry of
the base class to the ext_autoload.php file providing the XCLASS path. To keep
compatibility for 6.0 and 4.x, extension authors should add the ext_autoload
entry and additionally keep the TYPO3_CONF_VARS registration.
Extension authors should remove the three line XCLASS statement at the bottom
of class files now for any extension with a compatibility for 6.0 and above.

Removed Functionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Removed doNotLoadInFE flag

With TYPO3 4.3 the flag doNotLoadInFE flag was introduced in ext_emconf.php
extension files to hint the core that an extension has no frontend
functionality. The performance gain of this change in the frontend was minimal.
The flag is now removed and the according extList_FE setting in localconf.php
has no effect anymore.

* Removed system extension simulatestatic

The system extension to simulate static documents was removed from the core.
@TODO: Issue #36025 must be solved and this note here adapted, otherwise the
removal will be reverted.

* Removed TypoScript option noBlur

The ancient noBlur TypoScript setting for old Browsers (Internet Explorer <= 5.5)
was removed without alternative. The setting has no effect anymore and can be
removed from custom TypoScript objects, especially MENU.

* Removed internal history cleanup feature

TYPO3 will not clean the history (table "sys_history") on its own anymore.
This can lead to a large amount of data in this table. Please consider using
the garbage collection scheduler task to remove old entries.

* Removed TypoScript resources

The ancient feature to add images and other resources directly to TypoScript
records is dropped and the handling removed. This old feature - accessible
from the 'Info/modify' tab in the Template module - was hardly ever used
and was partly broken.
If this feature was still in use, it is recommended to not drop the
resource field from table sys_template during upgrading, fix the using
TypoScript to refer to resources located in fileadmin or similar directly,
and afterwards to finally delete the resource field in the install tool.

Changes and Improvements
===============================================================================

This will list all changes and improvements between TYPO3 4.7 and 6.0. For
technical details see ChangeLog included in the typo3_src package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Extbase and fluid always loaded

The core extensions 'extbase' and 'fluid' are used in core classes like t3lib
and in several important core extensions. Extbase and fluid are now required
extensions and always loaded.
